Overview

The accept property is an attribute of the file <input> type. It was
supported on the <form> element, but was removed in favor of file.

Because a given file type may be identified in more than one manner,
it's useful to provide a thorough set of type specifiers when you need
files of specific type, or use the wild card to denote a type of any
format is acceptable.

For instance, there are a number of ways Microsoft Word files can be
identified, so a site that accepts Word files might use an <input> like
this:

html

    <input
      type="file"
      id="docpicker"
      accept=".doc,.docx,application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" />

Whereas if you're accepting a media file, you may want to be include any
format of that media type:

html

    <input type="file" id="soundFile" accept="audio/*" />
    <input type="file" id="videoFile" accept="video/*" />
    <input type="file" id="imageFile" accept="image/*" />

The accept attribute doesn't validate the types of the selected files;
it provides hints for browsers to guide users towards selecting the
correct file types. It is still possible (in most cases) for users to
toggle an option in the file chooser that makes it possible to override
this and select any file they wish, and then choose incorrect file
types.

Because of this, you should make sure that expected requirement is
validated server-side.

Examples

When set on a file input type, the native file picker that opens up
should only enable selecting files of the correct file type. Most
operating systems lighten the files that don't match the criteria and
aren't selectable.

html

    <p>
      <label for="soundFile">Select an audio file:</label>
      <input type="file" id="soundFile" accept="audio/*" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <label for="videoFile">Select a video file:</label>
      <input type="file" id="videoFile" accept="video/*" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <label for="imageFile">Select some images:</label>
      <input type="file" id="imageFile" accept="image/*" multiple />
    </p>

Note the last example allows you to select multiple images. See the
multiple attribute for more information.

Unique file type specifiers

A unique file type specifier is a string that describes a type of file
that may be selected by the user in an <input> element of type file.
Each unique file type specifier may take one of the following forms:

-   A valid case-insensitive filename extension, starting with a period
    (".") character. For example: .jpg, .pdf, or .doc.
-   A valid MIME type string, with no extensions.
-   The string audio/* meaning "any audio file".
-   The string video/* meaning "any video file".
-   The string image/* meaning "any image file".

The accept attribute takes as its value a string containing one or more
of these unique file type specifiers, separated by commas. For example,
a file picker that needs content that can be presented as an image,
including both standard image formats and PDF files, might look like
this:

html

    <input type="file" accept="image/*,.pdf" />

Using file inputs

A basic example

html

    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <div>
        <label for="file">Choose file to upload</label>
        <input type="file" id="file" name="file" multiple />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

This produces the following output:

Note: You can find this example on GitHub too — see the source code, and
also see it running live.

Regardless of the user's device or operating system, the file input
provides a button that opens up a file picker dialog that allows the
user to choose a file.

Including the multiple attribute, as shown above, specifies that
multiple files can be chosen at once. The user can choose multiple files
from the file picker in any way that their chosen platform allows (e.g.
by holding down Shift or Control, and then clicking). If you only want
the user to choose a single file per <input>, omit the multiple
attribute.

Limiting accepted file types

Often you won't want the user to be able to pick any arbitrary type of
file; instead, you often want them to select files of a specific type or
types. For example, if your file input lets users upload a profile
picture, you probably want them to select web-compatible image formats,
such as JPEG or PNG.

Acceptable file types can be specified with the accept attribute, which
takes a comma-separated list of allowed file extensions or MIME types.
Some examples:

-   accept="image/png" or accept=".png" — Accepts PNG files.
-   accept="image/png, image/jpeg" or accept=".png, .jpg, .jpeg" —
    Accept PNG or JPEG files.
-   accept="image/*" — Accept any file with an image/* MIME type. (Many
    mobile devices also let the user take a picture with the camera when
    this is used.)
-   accept=".doc,.docx,.xml,application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"
    — accept anything that smells like an MS Word document.

Let's look at a more complete example:

html

    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <div>
        <label for="profile_pic">Choose file to upload</label>
        <input
          type="file"
          id="profile_pic"
          name="profile_pic"
          accept=".jpg, .jpeg, .png" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

# HTML attribute: autocomplete#

The HTML autocomplete attribute lets web developers specify what if any
permission the user agent has to provide automated assistance in filling
out form field values, as well as guidance to the browser as to the type
of information expected in the field.

It is available on <input> elements that take a text or numeric value as
input, <textarea> elements, <select> elements, and <form> elements.

The source of the suggested values is generally up to the browser;
typically values come from past values entered by the user, but they may
also come from pre-configured values. For instance, a browser might let
the user save their name, address, phone number, and email addresses for
autocomplete purposes. Perhaps the browser offers the ability to save
encrypted credit card information, for autocompletion following an
authentication procedure.

If an <input>, <select> or <textarea> element has no autocomplete
attribute, then browsers use the autocomplete attribute of the element's
form owner, which is either the <form> element that the element is a
descendant of, or the <form> whose id is specified by the form attribute
of the element (see the <form> autocomplete attribute).

Note: In order to provide autocompletion, user-agents might require
<input>/<select>/<textarea> elements to:

1.  Have a name and/or id attribute
2.  Be descendants of a <form> element
3.  The form to have a submit button

Values

"off"

    The browser is not permitted to automatically enter or select a
    value for this field. It is possible that the document or
    application provides its own autocomplete feature, or that security
    concerns require that the field's value not be automatically
    entered.

    Note: In most modern browsers, setting autocomplete to "off" will
    not prevent a password manager from asking the user if they would
    like to save username and password information, or from
    automatically filling in those values in a site's login form. See
    the autocomplete attribute and login fields.

"on"

    The browser is allowed to automatically complete the input. No
    guidance is provided as to the type of data expected in the field,
    so the browser may use its own judgement.

"name"

    The field expects the value to be a person's full name. Using "name"
    rather than breaking the name down into its components is generally
    preferred because it avoids dealing with the wide diversity of human
    names and how they are structured; however, you can use the
    following autocomplete values if you do need to break the name down
    into its components:

    "honorific-prefix"

        The prefix or title, such as "Mrs.", "Mr.", "Miss", "Ms.",
        "Dr.", or "Mlle.".

    "given-name"

        The given (or "first") name.

    "additional-name"

        The middle name.

    "family-name"

        The family (or "last") name.

    "honorific-suffix"

        The suffix, such as "Jr.", "B.Sc.", "PhD.", "MBASW", or "IV".

    "nickname"

        A nickname or handle.

"email"

    An email address.

"username"

    A username or account name.

"new-password"

    A new password. When creating a new account or changing passwords,
    this should be used for an "Enter your new password" or "Confirm new
    password" field, as opposed to a general "Enter your current
    password" field that might be present. This may be used by the
    browser both to avoid accidentally filling in an existing password
    and to offer assistance in creating a secure password (see also
    Preventing autofilling with autocomplete="new-password").

"current-password"

    The user's current password.

"one-time-code"

    A one-time password (OTP) for verifying user identity that is used
    as an additional factor in a sign-in flow. Most commonly this is a
    code received via some out-of-channel mechanism, such as SMS, email,
    or authenticator application.

"organization-title"

    A job title, or the title a person has within an organization, such
    as "Senior Technical Writer", "President", or "Assistant Troop
    Leader".

"organization"

    A company or organization name, such as "Acme Widget Company" or
    "Girl Scouts of America".

"street-address"

    A street address. This can be multiple lines of text, and should
    fully identify the location of the address within its second
    administrative level (typically a city or town), but should not
    include the city name, ZIP or postal code, or country name.

    "shipping"

        The street address to send the product. This can be combined
        with other tokens, such as "shipping street-address" and
        "shipping address-level2".

    "billing"

        The street address to associate with the form of payment used.
        This can be combined with other tokens, such as
        "billing street-address" and "billing address-level2".

"address-line1", "address-line2", "address-line3"

    Each individual line of the street address. These should only be
    present if the "street-address" is not present.

"address-level4"

    The finest-grained administrative level, in addresses which have
    four levels.

"address-level3"

    The third administrative level, in addresses with at least three
    administrative levels.

"address-level2"

    The second administrative level, in addresses with at least two of
    them. In countries with two administrative levels, this would
    typically be the city, town, village, or other locality in which the
    address is located.

"address-level1"

    The first administrative level in the address. This is typically the
    province in which the address is located. In the United States, this
    would be the state. In Switzerland, the canton. In the United
    Kingdom, the post town.

"country"

    A country or territory code.

"country-name"

    A country or territory name.

"postal-code"

    A postal code (in the United States, this is the ZIP code).

"cc-name"

    The full name as printed on or associated with a payment instrument
    such as a credit card. Using a full name field is preferred,
    typically, over breaking the name into pieces.

"cc-given-name"

    A given (first) name as given on a payment instrument like a credit
    card.

"cc-additional-name"

    A middle name as given on a payment instrument or credit card.

"cc-family-name"

    A family name, as given on a credit card.

"cc-number"

    A credit card number or other number identifying a payment method,
    such as an account number.

"cc-exp"

    A payment method expiration date, typically in the form "MM/YY" or
    "MM/YYYY".

"cc-exp-month"

    The month in which the payment method expires.

"cc-exp-year"

    The year in which the payment method expires.

"cc-csc"

    The security code for the payment instrument; on credit cards, this
    is the 3-digit verification number on the back of the card.

"cc-type"

    The type of payment instrument (such as "Visa" or "Master Card").

"transaction-currency"

    The currency in which the transaction is to take place.

"transaction-amount"

    The amount, given in the currency specified by
    "transaction-currency", of the transaction, for a payment form.

"language"

    A preferred language, given as a valid BCP 47 language tag.

"bday"

    A birth date, as a full date.

"bday-day"

    The day of the month of a birth date.

"bday-month"

    The month of the year of a birth date.

"bday-year"

    The year of a birth date.

"sex"

    A gender identity (such as "Female", "Fa'afafine", "Hijra", "Male",
    "Nonbinary"), as freeform text without newlines.

"tel"

    A full telephone number, including the country code. If you need to
    break the phone number up into its components, you can use these
    values for those fields:

    "tel-country-code"

        The country code, such as "1" for the United States, Canada, and
        other areas in North America and parts of the Caribbean.

    "tel-national"

        The entire phone number without the country code component,
        including a country-internal prefix. For the phone number
        "1-855-555-6502", this field's value would be "855-555-6502".

    "tel-area-code"

        The area code, with any country-internal prefix applied if
        appropriate.

    "tel-local"

        The phone number without the country or area code. This can be
        split further into two parts, for phone numbers which have an
        exchange number and then a number within the exchange. For the
        phone number "555-6502", use "tel-local-prefix" for "555" and
        "tel-local-suffix" for "6502".

"tel-extension"

    A telephone extension code within the phone number, such as a room
    or suite number in a hotel or an office extension in a company.

"impp"

    A URL for an instant messaging protocol endpoint, such as
    "xmpp:username@example.net".

"url"

    A URL, such as a home page or company website address as appropriate
    given the context of the other fields in the form.

"photo"

    The URL of an image representing the person, company, or contact
    information given in the other fields in the form.

"webauthn"

    Passkeys generated by the Web Authentication API, as requested by a
    conditional navigator.credentials.get() call (i.e., one that
    includes mediation: 'conditional'). See Sign in with a passkey
    through form autofill for more details.

See the WHATWG Standard for more detailed information.

Note: The autocomplete attribute also controls whether Firefox will —
unlike other browsers — persist the dynamic disabled state and (if
applicable) dynamic checkedness of an <input> element, <textarea>
element, or entire <form> across page loads. The persistence feature is
enabled by default. Setting the value of the autocomplete attribute to
off disables this feature. This works even when the autocomplete
attribute would normally not apply by virtue of its type. See Firefox
bug 654072.

Examples

html

    <div>
      <label for="cc-number">Enter your credit card number</label>
      <input name="cc-number" id="cc-number" autocomplete="off" />
    </div>

Administrative levels in addresses

The four administrative level fields (address-level1 through
address-level4) describe the address in terms of increasing levels of
precision within the country in which the address is located. Each
country has its own system of administrative levels, and may arrange the
levels in different orders when addresses are written.

address-level1 always represents the broadest administrative division;
it is the least-specific portion of the address short of the country
name.

Form layout flexibility

Given that different countries write their address in different ways,
with each field in different places within the address, and even
different sets and numbers of fields entirely, it can be helpful if,
when possible, your site is able to switch to the layout expected by
your users when presenting an address entry form, given the country the
address is located within.

Variations

The way each administrative level is used will vary from country to
country. Below are some examples; this is not meant to be an exhaustive
list.

United States

A typical home address within the United States looks like this:

432 Anywhere St Exampleville CA 95555

In the United States, the least-specific portion of the address is the
state, in this case "CA" (the official US Postal Service shorthand for
"California"). Thus address-level1 is the state, or "CA" in this case.

The second-least specific portion of the address is the city or town
name, so address-level2 is "Exampleville" in this example address.

United States addresses do not use levels 3 and up.

United Kingdom

Address input forms in the UK should contain one address level and one,
two or three address lines, depending on the address. A complete address
would look like so:

103 Frogmarch Street Upper-Wapping Winchelsea TN99 8ZZ

The address levels are:

-   address-level1: The post town — "Winchelsea" in this case.
-   address-line2: The locality — "Upper-Wapping" in this case.
-   address-line1: The house/street particulars — "103 Frogmarch
    Street".

The postcode is separate. Note that you can actually use just the
postcode and address-line1 to successfully deliver mail in the UK, so
they should be the only mandatory items, but usually people tend to
provide more details.

China

China can use as many as three administrative levels: the province, the
city, and the district.

The 6 digit postal code is not always needed but when supplied it is
placed separately with a label for clarity. For example:

北京市东城区建国门北大街 8 号华润大厦 17 层 1708 单元 邮编：100005

Japan

An address in Japan is typically written in one line, in an order from
the least-specific to more-specific portions (in reverse order to the
United States). There are two or three administrative levels in an
address. Additional line can be used to show building names and room
numbers. The postal code is separate. For example:

〒 381-0000 長野県長野市某町 123

"〒" and following seven digits shows the postal code.

address-level1 is used for prefectures or the Tokyo Metropolis; "長野県"
(Nagano Prefecture) is in this case. address-level2 is typically used
for cities, counties, towns and villages; "長野市" (Nagano City) in this
case. "某町 123" is address-line1 which consists of an area name and a
lot number.

# HTML attribute: capture#

The capture attribute specifies that, optionally, a new file should be
captured, and which device should be used to capture that new media of a
type defined by the accept attribute.

Values include user and environment. The capture attribute is supported
on the file input type.

The capture attribute takes as its value a string that specifies which
camera to use for capture of image or video data, if the accept
attribute indicates that the input should be of one of those types.

  Value         Description
  ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  user          The user-facing camera and/or microphone should be used.
  environment   The outward-facing camera and/or microphone should be used

Note: Capture was previously a Boolean attribute which, if present,
requested that the device's media capture device(s) such as camera or
microphone be used instead of requesting a file input.

# HTML attribute: crossorigin#

The crossorigin attribute, valid on the <audio>, <img>, <link>,
<script>, and <video> elements, provides support for CORS, defining how
the element handles cross-origin requests, thereby enabling the
configuration of the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.
Depending on the element, the attribute can be a CORS settings
attribute.

The crossorigin content attribute on media elements is a CORS settings
attribute.

These attributes are enumerated, and have the following possible values:

anonymous

    Request uses CORS headers and credentials flag is set to
    'same-origin'. There is no exchange of user credentials via cookies,
    client-side TLS certificates or HTTP authentication, unless
    destination is the same origin.

use-credentials

    Request uses CORS headers, credentials flag is set to 'include' and
    user credentials are always included.

""

    Setting the attribute name to an empty value, like crossorigin or
    crossorigin="", is the same as anonymous.

An invalid keyword and an empty string will be handled as the anonymous
keyword.

By default (that is, when the attribute is not specified), CORS is not
used at all. The user agent will not ask for permission for full access
to the resource and in the case of a cross-origin request, certain
limitations will be applied based on the type of element concerned:

  ------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
  Element             Restrictions
  img, audio, video   When resource is placed in <canvas>, element is marked as tainted.
  script              Access to error logging via window.onerror will be limited.
  link                Request with no appropriate crossorigin header may be discarded.
  ------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The crossorigin attribute is not supported for rel="icon" in
Chromium-based browsers. See the open Chromium issue.

Example: crossorigin with the <script> element

You can use the following <script> element to tell a browser to execute
the https://example.com/example-framework.js script without sending
user-credentials.

html

    <script
      src="https://example.com/example-framework.js"
      crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

Example: Web manifest with credentials

The use-credentials value must be used when fetching a manifest that
requires credentials, even if the file is from the same origin.

html

    <link rel="manifest" href="/app.webmanifest" crossorigin="use-credentials" />

# HTML attribute: dirname#

The dirname attribute can be used on <textarea> and <input> elements and
describes the directionality of the element's text content during form
submission. The browser uses this attribute's value to determine whether
text the user has entered is left-to-right or right-to-left oriented.
When used, the element's text directionality value is included in form
submission data along with the dirname attribute's value as the name of
the field.

Usage notes

The dirname attribute can be used on any <textarea> element, or any
<input> element with text, search, tel, url, or email type.

The format of the submitted data is {dirname_value}={direction} where
{dirname_value} is the value of the dirname attribute and {direction} is
the directionality of the text. For example, if the user enters "Hello"
in an element with the attributes name="comment" and
dirname="comment-direction", the URL-encoded form submission data for
GET requests will be comment=Hello&comment-direction=ltr. The
directionality is one of the following:

rtl

    The text entered by the user is in a right-to-left writing
    direction.

ltr

    The text entered by the user is in a left-to-right writing
    direction.

If no text directionality is specified, the user agent will use the
directionality of the parent element containing the form, and if that is
not specified, the default directionality of the user agent.

Examples

Textarea element directionality

In this example, the dir="auto" attribute on the textarea element allows
the text directionality to be determined automatically based on the text
entered by the user:

html

    <form method="get" action="https://www.example.com/submit">
      <textarea name="comment" dir="auto" dirname="comment-direction">سيب</textarea>
      <button type="submit">Send my greetings</button>
    </form>

When the user submits the form, the user agent includes two fields, one
called comment with the value "سيب", and one called comment-direction
with the value "rtl". The URL-encoded submission body looks like this:

url

    https://www.example.com/submit?comment=%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A8&comment-direction=rtl

Input element directionality

In this example, the dir="auto" attribute on the input element allows
the text directionality to be determined automatically based on the text
entered by the user:

html

    <form method="get" action="https://www.example.com/submit">
      <input
        type="text"
        name="comment-input"
        dir="auto"
        dirname="comment-direction"
        value="Hello" />
      <button type="submit">Send my greetings</button>
    </form>

When the user submits the form, the user agent includes two fields, one
called comment-input with the value "Hello", and one called
comment-direction with the value "ltr":

url

    https://www.example.com/submit?comment-input=Hello&comment-direction=ltr

Inheriting directionality

The following <input> and <textarea> elements do not have a dir
attribute, so they inherit the explicit directionality of their parent
element, which is rtl:

html

    <div dir="rtl">
      <form method="get" action="https://www.example.com/submit">
        <input
          type="text"
          name="user"
          dirname="user-direction"
          value="LTR Username" />
        <textarea name="comment" dirname="comment-direction">LTR Comment</textarea>
        <button type="submit">Post Comment</button>
      </form>
    </div>

The URL-encoded submission body looks like this:

url

    https://www.example.com/submit?user=LTR+Username&user-direction=rtl&comment=LTR+Comment&comment-direction=rtl

Overview

If the disabled attribute is specified on a form control, the element
and its form control descendants do not participate in constraint
validation. Often browsers grey out such controls and it won't receive
any browsing events, like mouse clicks or focus-related ones.

The disabled attribute is supported by <button>, <fieldset>, <optgroup>,
<option>, <select>, <textarea> and <input>.

This Boolean disabled attribute indicates that the user cannot interact
with the control or its descendant controls. If this attribute is not
specified, the control inherits its setting from the containing element,
for example fieldset; if there is no containing element with the
disabled attribute set, and the control itself does not have the
attribute, then the control is enabled. If declared on an <optgroup>,
the select is still interactive (unless otherwise disabled), but none of
the items in the option group are selectable.

Note: If a <fieldset> is disabled, the descendant form controls are all
disabled, with the exception of form controls within the <legend>.

When a supporting element has the disabled attribute applied, the
:disabled pseudo-class also applies to it. Conversely, elements that
support the disabled attribute but don't have the attribute set match
the :enabled pseudo-class.

This Boolean attribute prevents the user from interacting with the
button. If this attribute isn't set, the button can still be disabled
from a containing element, for example <fieldset>; if there is no
containing element with the disabled attribute set, then the button is
enabled.

Firefox will, unlike other browsers, persist the dynamic disabled state
of a <button> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to
control this feature.

Attribute interactions

The difference between disabled and readonly is that read-only controls
can still function and are still focusable, whereas disabled controls
can not receive focus and are not submitted with the form and generally
do not function as controls until they are enabled.

Because a disabled field cannot have its value changed, required does
not have any effect on inputs with the disabled attribute also
specified. Additionally, since the elements become immutable, most other
attributes, such as pattern, have no effect, until the control is
enabled.

Note: The required attribute is not permitted on inputs with the
disabled attribute specified.

Usability

Browsers display disabled form controls greyed as disabled form controls
are immutable, won't receive focus or any browsing events, like mouse
clicks or focus-related ones, and aren't submitted with the form.

If present on a supporting elements, the :disabled pseudo class will
match. If the attribute is not included, the :enabled pseudo class will
match. If the element doesn't support the disabled attribute, the
attribute will have no effect, including not leading to being matched by
the :disabled and :enabled pseudo classes.

Constraint validation

If the element is disabled, then the element's value can not receive
focus and cannot be updated by the user, and does not participate in
constraint validation.

Examples

When form controls are disabled, many browsers will display them in a
lighter, greyed-out color by default. Here are examples of a disabled
checkbox, radio button, <option> and <optgroup>, as well as some form
controls that are disabled via the disabled attribute set on the
ancestor <fieldset> element. The <option>s are disabled, but the
<select> itself is not. We could have disable the entire <select> by
adding the attribute to that element rather than its descendants.

      <legend>Checkboxes</legend>

# HTML attribute: elementtiming#

The elementtiming attribute is used to indicate that an element is
flagged for tracking by PerformanceObserver objects using the "element"
type. For more details, see the PerformanceElementTiming interface.

This attribute may be applied to <img>, <image> elements inside an
<svg>, poster images of <video> elements, elements which have a
background-image, and elements containing text nodes, such as a <p>.

In the DOM, this attribute is reflected as Element.elementTiming.

Usage

The value given for elementtiming becomes an identifier for the observed
element.

html

    <img alt="alt" src="img.jpg" elementtiming="label for element" />

Good contenders for elements you might want to observe are:

-   The main image for an article.
-   A blog post title
-   Images in a carousel for a shopping site.
-   The poster image for the main video on a page.

Examples

html

    <img alt="Alt for a main blog post image" src="my-massive-image.jpg" elementtiming="Main image">

    <p elementtiming="important-text">Some very important information.</p">

Content versus IDL attributes

In HTML, most attributes have two faces: the content attribute and the
IDL (Interface Definition Language) attribute.

The content attribute is the attribute as you set it from the content
(the HTML code) and you can set it or get it via element.setAttribute()
or element.getAttribute(). The content attribute is always a string even
when the expected value should be an integer. For example, to set an
<input> element's maxlength to 42 using the content attribute, you have
to call setAttribute("maxlength", "42") on that element.

The IDL attribute is also known as a JavaScript property. These are the
attributes you can read or set using JavaScript properties like
element.foo. The IDL attribute is always going to use (but might
transform) the underlying content attribute to return a value when you
get it and is going to save something in the content attribute when you
set it. In other words, the IDL attributes, in essence, reflect the
content attributes.

Most of the time, IDL attributes will return their values as they are
really used. For example, the default type for <input> elements is
"text", so if you set input.type="foobar", the <input> element will be
of type text (in the appearance and the behavior) but the "type" content
attribute's value will be "foobar". However, the type IDL attribute will
return the string "text".

IDL attributes are not always strings; for example, input.maxlength is a
number (a signed long). When using IDL attributes, you read or set
values of the desired type, so input.maxlength is always going to return
a number and when you set input.maxlength, it wants a number. If you
pass another type, it is automatically converted to a number as
specified by the standard JavaScript rules for type conversion.

IDL attributes can reflect other types such as unsigned long, URLs,
booleans, etc. Unfortunately, there are no clear rules and the way IDL
attributes behave in conjunction with their corresponding content
attributes depends on the attribute. Most of the time, it will follow
the rules laid out in the specification, but sometimes it doesn't. HTML
specifications try to make this as developer-friendly as possible, but
for various reasons (mostly historical), some attributes behave oddly
(select.size, for example) and you should read the specifications to
understand how exactly they behave.

Boolean Attributes

Some content attributes (e.g. required, readonly, disabled) are called
boolean attributes. If a boolean attribute is present, its value is
true, and if it's absent, its value is false.

HTML defines restrictions on the allowed values of boolean attributes:
If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string
(equivalently, the attribute may have an unassigned value), or a value
that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the attribute's canonical
name, with no leading or trailing whitespace. The following examples are
valid ways to mark up a boolean attribute:

html

    <div itemscope>This is valid HTML but invalid XML.</div>
    <div itemscope=itemscope>This is also valid HTML but invalid XML.</div>
    <div itemscope="">This is valid HTML and also valid XML.</div>
    <div itemscope="itemscope">
      This is also valid HTML and XML, but perhaps a bit verbose.
    </div>

To be clear, the values "true" and "false" are not allowed on boolean
attributes. To represent a false value, the attribute has to be omitted
altogether. This restriction clears up some common misunderstandings:
With checked="false" for example, the element's checked attribute would
be interpreted as true because the attribute is present.

Event handler attributes

Warning: The use of event handler content attributes is discouraged. The
mix of HTML and JavaScript often produces unmaintainable code, and the
execution of event handler attributes may also be blocked by content
security policies.

In addition to the attributes listed in the table above, global event
handlers — such as onclick — can also be specified as content attributes
on all elements.

All event handler attributes accept a string. The string will be used to
synthesize a JavaScript function like function name(/*args*/) {body},
where name is the attribute's name, and body is the attribute's value.
The handler receives the same parameters as its JavaScript event handler
counterpart — most handlers receive only one event parameter, while
onerror receives five: event, source, lineno, colno, error. This means
you can, in general, use the event variable within the attribute.

html

    <div onclick="console.log(event)">Click me!</div>
    <!-- The synthesized handler has a name; you can reference itself -->
    <div onclick="console.log(onclick)">Click me!</div>

# HTML attribute: max#

The max attribute defines the maximum value that is acceptable and valid
for the input containing the attribute. If the value of the element is
greater than this, the element fails validation. This value must be
greater than or equal to the value of the min attribute. If the max
attribute is present but is not specified or is invalid, no max value is
applied. If the max attribute is valid and a non-empty value is greater
than the maximum allowed by the max attribute, constraint validation
will prevent form submission.

Valid for the numeric input types, including the date, month, week,
time, datetime-local, number and range types, and both the <progress>
and <meter> elements, the max attribute is a number that specifies the
most positive value a form control to be considered valid.

If the value exceeds the max value allowed, the
validityState.rangeOverflow will be true, and the control will be
matched by the :out-of-range and :invalid pseudo-classes.

Syntax

  Input type       Syntax             Example
  ---------------- ------------------ ------------------------------------------------------
  date             yyyy-mm-dd         <input type="date" max="2019-12-25" step="1">
  month            yyyy-mm            <input type="month" max="2019-12" step="12">
  week             yyyy-W##           <input type="week" max="2019-W23" step="">
  time             hh:mm              <input type="time" max="17:00" step="900">
  datetime-local   yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm   <input type="datetime-local" max="2019-12-25T23:59">
  number           <number>           <input type="number" min="0" step="5" max="100">
  range            <number>           <input type="range" min="60" step="5" max="100">

  : Syntax for max values by input type

Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the maximum
value set, the value is considered invalid in constraint validation and
will match the :invalid and :out-of-range pseudo-classes.

See Client-side validation and rangeOverflow for more information.

For the <progress> element, the max attribute describes how much work
the task indicated by the progress element requires. If present, must
have a value greater than zero and be a valid floating point number. For
the <meter> element, the max attribute defines the upper numeric bound
of the measured range. This must be greater than the minimum value (min
attribute), if specified. In both cases, if omitted, the value defaults
to 1.

  Input type   Syntax     Example
  ------------ ---------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <progress>   <number>   <progress id="file" max="100" value="70"> 70% </progress>
  <meter>      <number>   <meter id="fuel" min="0" max="100" low="33" high="66" optimum="80" value="40"> at 40/100</meter>

  : Syntax for max values for other elements

Accessibility concerns

Provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form
and use individual form controls. Indicate any required and optional
input, data formats, and other relevant information. When using the max
attribute, ensure this maximum requirement is understood by the user.
Providing instructions within the <label> may be sufficient. If
providing instructions outside of labels, which allows more flexible
positioning and design, consider using aria-labelledby or
aria-describedby.

# HTML attribute: maxlength#

The maxlength attribute defines the maximum string length that the user
can enter into an <input> or <textarea>. The attribute must have an
integer value of 0 or higher.

The length is measured in UTF-16 code units, which (for most scripts) is
equivalent to the number of characters. If no maxlength is specified, or
an invalid value is specified, the input has no maximum length.

Any maxlength value must be greater than or equal to the value of
minlength, if present and valid. The input will fail constraint
validation if the length of the text value of the field is greater than
maxlength UTF-16 code units long. Constraint validation is only applied
when the value is changed by the user.

Constraint validation

While the browser will generally prevent user from entering more text
than the maxlength attribute allows, should the length be longer than
the maxlength allows, the read-only tooLong property of a ValidityState
object will be true.

# HTML attribute: min#

The min attribute defines the minimum value that is acceptable and valid
for the input containing the attribute. If the value of the element is
less than this, the element fails validation. This value must be less
than or equal to the value of the max attribute.

Some input types have a default minimum. If the input has no default
minimum and a value is specified for min that can't be converted to a
valid number (or no minimum value is set), the input has no minimum
value.

It is valid for the input types including: date, month, week, time,
datetime-local, number and range types, and the <meter> element.

Syntax

  Input type       Syntax             Example
  ---------------- ------------------ ------------------------------------------------------
  date             yyyy-mm-dd         <input type="date" min="2019-12-25" step="1">
  month            yyyy-mm            <input type="month" min="2019-12" step="12">
  week             yyyy-W##           <input type="week" min="2019-W23" step="">

  range            <number>           <input type="range" min="60" step="5" max="100">

  : Syntax for min values by input type

Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the min value
set, the value is considered invalid in constraint validation and will
match the :invalid and :out-of-range pseudo-classes.

See Client-side validation and rangeUnderflow for more information.

For the <meter> element, the min attribute defines the lower numeric
bound of the measured range. This must be less than the minimum value
(max attribute), if specified. In both cases, if omitted, the value
defaults to 1.

  Input type   Syntax     Example
  ------------ ---------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <meter>      <number>   <meter id="fuel" min="0" max="100" low="33" high="66" optimum="80" value="40"> at 40/100</meter>

  : Syntax for min values for other elements

Impact on step

The value of min and step define what are valid values, even if the step
attribute is not included, as step defaults to 0.

We add a big red border around invalid inputs:

css

    input:invalid {
      border: solid red 3px;
    }

Then define an input with a minimum value of 7.2, omitting the step
attribute, wherein it defaults to 1.

html

    <input id="myNumber" name="myNumber" type="number" min="7.2" value="8" />

Because step defaults to 1, valid values include 7.2, 8.2, 9.2, and so
on. The value 8 is not valid. As we included an invalid value,
supporting browsers will show the value as invalid.

If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for number and range, and
1 unit type (second, week, month, day) for the date/time input types.

Accessibility concerns

Provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form
and use individual form controls. Indicate any required and optional
input, data formats, and other relevant information. When using the min
attribute, ensure this minimum requirement is understood by the user.

# HTML attribute: minlength#

The minlength attribute defines the minimum string length that the user
can enter into an <input> or <textarea>. The attribute must have an
integer value of 0 or higher.

The length is measured in UTF-16 code units, which (for most scripts) is
equivalent to the number of characters. If no minlength is specified, or
an invalid value is specified, the input has no minimum length. This
value must be less than or equal to the value of maxlength, otherwise
the value will never be valid, as it is impossible to meet both
criteria.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
value of the field is less than minlength UTF-16 code units long, with
validityState.tooShort returning true. Constraint validation is only
applied when the value is changed by the user. Once submission fails,
some browsers will display an error message indicating the minimum
length required and the current length.

Overview

Depending on the type, the form control may have a different appearance
if the multiple attribute is set. For the file input type, the native
messaging the browser provides differs. In Firefox, the file input reads
"No files selected" when the attribute is present and "No file selected"
when it is not. Most browsers display a scrolling list box for a
<select> control with the multiple attribute set and a single line
dropdown when the attribute is omitted. The email input displays the
same whether or not the multiple attribute is included, but will match
the :invalid pseudo-class if more than one comma-separated email address
is included if the attribute is not present.

When multiple is set on the email input type, the user can include zero
(if not also required), one or more comma-separated email addresses.

html

    <input type="email" multiple name="emails" id="emails" />

If and only if the multiple attribute is specified, the value can be a
list of properly-formed comma-separated email addresses. Any trailing
and leading whitespace is removed from each address in the list.

When multiple is set on the file input type, the user can select one or
more files. The user can choose multiple files from the file picker in
any way that their chosen platform allows (e.g. by holding down Shift or
Control, and then clicking).

html

    <input type="file" multiple name="uploads" id="uploads" />

When the attribute is omitted, the user can only select a single file
per <input>.

The multiple attribute on the <select> element represents a control for
selecting zero or more options from the list of options. Otherwise, the
<select> element represents a control for selecting a single <option>
from the list of options.

html

    <select multiple name="dwarfs" id="dwarfs">
      <option>Grumpy</option>
      <option>Happy</option>
      <option>Sleepy</option>
      <option>Bashful</option>
      <option>Sneezy</option>
      <option>Dopey</option>
      <option>Doc</option>
    </select>

When multiple is specified, most browsers will show a scrolling list box
instead of a single line dropdown.

Accessibility concerns

and use individual form controls. Indicate any required and optional
input, data formats, and other relevant information. When using the
multiple attribute, inform the user that multiple values are allowed and
provide directions on how to provide multiple values, such as "separate
email addresses with a comma."

Setting size="1" on a multiple select can make it appear as a single
select in some browsers, but then it doesn't expand on focus, harming
usability. Don't do that. If you do change the appearance of a select,
and even if you don't, make sure to inform the user that more than one
option can be selected by another method.

Examples

email input

html

    <label for="emails">Who do you want to email?</label>
    <input
      type="email"
      multiple
      name="emails"
      id="emails"
      list="dwarf-emails"
      required
      size="64" />

    <datalist id="dwarf-emails">
      <option value="grumpy@woodworkers.com">Grumpy</option>
      <option value="happy@woodworkers.com">Happy</option>
      <option value="sleepy@woodworkers.com">Sleepy</option>
      <option value="bashful@woodworkers.com">Bashful</option>
      <option value="sneezy@woodworkers.com">Sneezy</option>
      <option value="dopey@woodworkers.com">Dopey</option>
      <option value="doc@woodworkers.com">Doc</option>
    </datalist>

    input:invalid {
      border: red solid 3px;
    }

If and only if the multiple attribute is specified, the value can be a
list of properly-formed comma-separated email addresses. Any trailing
and leading whitespace is removed from each address in the list. If the
required attribute is present, at least one email address is required.

Some browsers support the appearance of the list of options from the
associated <datalist> for subsequent email addresses when multiple is
present. Others do not.

file input

When multiple is set on the file input type, the user can select one or
more files:

html

    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <p>
        <label for="uploads"> Choose the images you want to upload: </label>
        <input
          type="file"
          id="uploads"
          name="uploads"
          accept=".jpg, .jpeg, .png, .svg, .gif"
          multiple />
      </p>
      <p>
        <label for="text">Pick a text file to upload: </label>
        <input type="file" id="text" name="text" accept=".txt" />
      </p>
      <p>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </p>
    </form>

Note the difference in appearance between the example with multiple set
and the other file input without.

When the form is submitted, had we used method="get" each selected
file's name would have been added to URL parameters
as?uploads=img1.jpg&uploads=img2.svg. However, since we are submitting
multipart form data, we much use post. See the <form> element and
sending form data for more information.

select

The multiple attribute on the <select> element represents a control for
selecting zero or more options from the list of options. Otherwise, the
<select> element represents a control for selecting a single <option>
from the list of options. The control generally has a different
appearance based on the presence of the multiple attribute, with most
browsers displaying a scrolling list box instead of a single line
dropdown when the attribute is present.

html

    <form method="get" action="#">
      <p>
        <label for="dwarfs">Select the dwarf woodsman you like:</label>
        <select multiple name="dwarfs" id="dwarfs">
          <option>grumpy@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>happy@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>sleepy@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>bashful@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>sneezy@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>dopey@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>doc@woodworkers.com</option>
        </select>
      </p>
      <p>
        <label for="favoriteOnly">Select your favorite:</label>
        <select name="favoriteOnly" id="favoriteOnly">
          <option>grumpy@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>happy@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>sleepy@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>bashful@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>sneezy@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>dopey@woodworkers.com</option>
          <option>doc@woodworkers.com</option>
        </select>
      </p>
      <p>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </p>
    </form>

Note the difference in appearance between the two form controls.

css

    /* uncomment this CSS to make the multiple the same height as the single */

    /*
    select[multiple] {
      height: 1.5em;
      vertical-align: top;
    }
    select[multiple]:focus,
    select[multiple]:active {
      height: auto;
    }
    */

There are a few ways to select multiple options in a <select> element
with a multiple attribute. Depending on the operating system, mouse
users can hold the Ctrl, Command, or Shift keys and then click multiple
options to select/deselect them. Keyboard users can select multiple
contiguous items by focusing on the <select> element, selecting an item
at the top or bottom of the range they want to select using the Up and
Down cursor keys to go up and down the options. The selection of
non-contiguous is not as well-supported: items should be able to be
selected and deselected by pressing Space, but support varies between
browsers.

# HTML attribute: pattern#

The pattern attribute specifies a regular expression the form control's
value should match. If a non-null value doesn't conform to the
constraints set by the pattern value, the ValidityState object's
read-only patternMismatch property will be true.

Overview

The pattern attribute is an attribute of the text, tel, email, url,
password, and search input types.

The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression which the
input's value must match for the value to pass constraint validation. It
must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp
type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions.

The pattern's regular expression is compiled with the 'v' flag. This
makes the regular expression unicode-aware, and also changes how
character classes are interpreted. This allows character class set
intersection and subtraction operations, and in addition to ] and \, the
following characters must be escaped using a \ backslash if they
represent literal characters: (, ), [, {, }, /, -, |. Before mid-2023,
the 'u' flag was specified instead; If you're updating older code, this
document outlines the differences.

The pattern's regular expression must match the entire input's value,
rather than matching a substring - as if a ^(?: were implied at the
start of the pattern and )$ at the end.

No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. No
regular expression is applied if the attribute value is absent, an empty
string, or invalid.

Some of the input types supporting the pattern attribute, notably the
email and url input types, have expected value syntaxes that must be
matched. If the pattern attribute isn't present, and the value doesn't
match the expected syntax for that value type, the ValidityState
object's read-only typeMismatch property will be true.

Constraint validation

If the input's value is not the empty string and the value does not
match the entire regular expression, there is a constraint violation
reported by the ValidityState object's patternMismatch property being
true.

Note: If the pattern attribute is specified with no value, its value is
implicitly the empty string. Thus, any non-empty input value will result
in constraint violation.

Usability and accessibility considerations

When including a pattern, provide a description of the pattern in
visible text near the control. Additionally, include a title attribute
which gives a description of the pattern. User agents may use the title
contents during constraint validation to tell the user that the pattern
is not matched. Some browsers show a tooltip with title contents,
improving usability for sighted users. Additionally, assistive
technology may read the title aloud when the control gains focus, but
this should not be relied upon for accessibility.

Only relying on the title attribute for the visual display of text
content is discouraged, as many user agents do not expose the attribute
in an accessible manner. Although some browsers show a tooltip when an
element with a title is hovered, that leaves out keyboard-only and
touch-only users. This is one of the several reasons you must include
information informing users how to fill out the control to match the
requirements.

While titles are used by some browsers to populate error messaging,
because browsers sometimes also show the title as text on hover, it
therefore shows in non-error situations, so be careful not to word
titles as if an error has occurred.

Examples

Matching a phone number

Given the following:

html

    <p>
      <label>
        Enter your phone number in the format (123) - 456 - 7890 (<input
          name="tel1"
          type="tel"
          pattern="[0-9]{3}"
          placeholder="###"
          aria-label="3-digit area code"
          size="2" />) -
        <input
          name="tel2"
          type="tel"
          pattern="[0-9]{3}"
          placeholder="###"
          aria-label="3-digit prefix"
          size="2" />
        -
        <input
          name="tel3"
          type="tel"
          pattern="[0-9]{4}"
          placeholder="####"
          aria-label="4-digit number"
          size="3" />
      </label>
    </p>

Here we have 3 sections for a north American phone number with an
implicit label encompassing all three components of the phone number,
expecting 3-digits, 3-digits and 4-digits respectively, as defined by
the pattern attribute set on each.

If the values are too long or too short, or contain characters that
aren't digits, the patternMismatch will be true. When true, the element
matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-classes.

css

    input:invalid {
      border: red solid 3px;
    }

If we had used minlength and maxlength attributes instead, we may have
seen validityState.tooLong or validityState.tooShort being true.

Specifying a pattern

You can use the pattern attribute to specify a regular expression that
the inputted value must match in order to be considered valid (see
Validating against a regular expression for a simple crash course on
using regular expressions to validate inputs).

The example below restricts the value to 4-8 characters and requires
that it contain only lower-case letters.

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="uname"
          name="name"
          required
          size="45"
          pattern="[a-z]{4,8}"
          title="4 to 8 lowercase letters" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
        <p>Usernames must be lowercase and 4-8 characters in length.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    p {
      font-size: 80%;
      color: #999;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

This renders like so:

# HTML attribute: placeholder#

The placeholder attribute defines the text displayed in a form control
when the control has no value. The placeholder text should provide a
brief hint to the user as to the expected type of data that should be
entered into the control.

Effective placeholder text includes a word or short phrase that hints at
the expected data type, not an explanation or prompt. The placeholder
must not be used instead of a <label>. As the placeholder is not visible
if the value of the form control is not null, using placeholder instead
of a <label> for a prompt harms usability and accessibility.

The placeholder attribute is supported by the following input types:
text, search, url, tel, email, and password. It is also supported by the
<textarea> element. The example below shows the placeholder attribute in
use to explain the expected format of an input field.

Note: The placeholder attribute can't include any line feeds (LF) or
carriage returns (CR). If either is included in the value, the
placeholder text will be clipped.

Accessibility concerns

Placeholders should only be used to show an example of the type of data
that should be entered into a form; never as a replacement for a <label>
element; doing so harms accessibility and user experience.

The <label> text is visually and programmatically associated with its
corresponding form control. Screen readers don't announce placeholder
content by default, but they do announce label content; it's the label
that informs assistive technology users what data should be entered in
the control. Labels also improve user experience for users of pointing
devices: When a user clicks, touches, or taps a <label>, focus is moved
to the label's associated form control.

Placeholders can not be relied upon as a replacement for a label even
for those not relying on assistive technology. Placeholder text is
displayed at lower color contrast than the default form control text.
This is by design, as you don't want users to be confused by what is
placeholder text versus what is a filled-in form field. However, this
lack of contrast can cause issues for low-vision users. Additionally,
placeholder text disappears from form fields when users start entering
text. If the placeholder text contains instructional information or
examples that disappear, it can be confusing to users with cognitive
issues and can make the form inaccessible if the placeholder contained
the label.

Example

HTML

html

    <form action="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/placeholder">
      <label for="name">Enter your name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="e.g. Mike Shinoda" />

Overview

If the readonly attribute is specified on an input element, because the
user can not edit the input, the element does not participate in
constraint validation.

The readonly attribute is supported by text, search, url, tel, email,
password, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, and number <input>
types and the <textarea> form control elements. If present on any of
these input types and elements, the :read-only pseudo class will match.
If the attribute is not included, the :read-write pseudo class will
match.

The attribute is not supported or relevant to <select> or input types
that are already not mutable, such as checkbox and radio or cannot, by
definition, start with a value, such as the file input type. range and
color, as both have default values. It is also not supported on hidden
as it can not be expected that a user to fill out a form that is hidden.
Nor is it supported on any of the button types, including image.

Note: Only text controls can be made read-only, since for other controls
(such as checkboxes and buttons) there is no useful distinction between
being read-only and being disabled, so the readonly attribute does not
apply.

When an input has the readonly attribute, the :read-only pseudo-class
also applies to it. Conversely, inputs that support the readonly
attribute but don't have the attribute set match the :read-write
pseudo-class.

Attribute interactions

The difference between disabled and readonly is that read-only controls
can still function and are still focusable, whereas disabled controls
can not receive focus and are not submitted with the form and generally
do not function as controls until they are enabled.

Because a read-only field cannot have its value changed by a user
interaction, required does not have any effect on inputs with the
readonly attribute also specified.

The only way to modify dynamically the value of the readonly attribute
is through a script.

Note: The required attribute is not permitted on inputs with the
readonly attribute specified.

Usability

Browsers display the readonly attribute.

Constraint validation

If the element is read-only, then the element's value can not be updated
by the user, and does not participate in constraint validation.

Example

HTML

html

    <div class="group">
      <input type="text" value="Some value" readonly="readonly" id="text" />
      <label for="text">Text box</label>

    <div class="group">
      <input type="date" value="2020-01-01" readonly="readonly" id="date" />

The dns-prefetch keyword for the rel attribute of the <link> element is
a hint to browsers that the user is likely to need resources from the
target resource's origin, and therefore the browser can likely improve
the user experience by preemptively performing DNS resolution for that
origin.

# HTML attribute: rel#

The rel attribute defines the relationship between a linked resource and
the current document. Valid on <link>, <a>, <area>, and <form>, the
supported values depend on the element on which the attribute is found.

The type of relationships is given by the value of the rel attribute,
which, if present, must have a value that is an unordered set of unique
space-separated keywords. Differently from a class name, which does not
express semantics, the rel attribute must express tokens that are
semantically valid for both machines and humans. The current registries
for the possible values of the rel attribute are the IANA link relation
registry, the HTML Living Standard, and the freely-editable
existing-rel-values page in the microformats wiki, as suggested by the
Living Standard. If a rel attribute not present in one of the three
sources above is used some HTML validators (such as the W3C Markup
Validation Service) will generate a warning.

The following table lists some of the most important existing keywords.
Every keyword within a space-separated value should be unique within
that value.

The rel attribute is relevant to the <link>, <a>, <area>, and <form>
elements, but some values only relevant to a subset of those elements.
Like all HTML keyword attribute values, these values are
case-insensitive.

The rel attribute has no default value. If the attribute is omitted or
if none of the values in the attribute are supported, then the document
has no particular relationship with the destination resource other than
there being a hyperlink between the two. In this case, on <link> and
<form>, if the rel attribute is absent, has no keywords, or if not one
or more of the space-separated keywords above, then the element does not
create any links. <a> and <area> will still created links, but without a
defined relationship.

Values

alternate

    Indicates an alternate representation of the current document. Valid
    for <link>, <a>, and <area>, the meaning depends on the values of
    the other attributes.

    -   With the stylesheet keyword on a <link>, it creates an alternate
        stylesheet.
        html

            <!-- a persistent style sheet -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css" />
            <!-- alternate style sheets -->
            <link
              rel="alternate stylesheet"
              href="highcontrast.css"
              title="High contrast" />
    -   With an hreflang attribute that differs from the document
        language, it indicates a translation.
    -   With the type attribute value of "application/rss+xml"or
        "application/atom+xml", it creates a hyperlink referencing a
        syndication feed.
        html

            <link
              rel="alternate"
              type="application/atom+xml"
              href="posts.xml"
              title="Blog" />
    -   Otherwise, it creates a hyperlink referencing an alternate
        representation of the current document, whose nature is given by
        the hreflang and type attributes.
        -   If hreflang is given alongside alternate, and the value of
            hreflang is different from the current document's language,
            it indicates that the referenced document is a translation.
        -   If type is given alongside alternate, it indicates that the
            referenced document is an alternative format (such as a
            PDF).
        -   The hreflang and type attributes may both be given alongside
            alternate.

        html

            <link
              rel="alternate"
              href="/fr/html/print"
              hreflang="fr"
              type="text/html"
              media="print"
              title="French HTML (for printing)" />
            <link
              rel="alternate"
              href="/fr/pdf"
              hreflang="fr"
              type="application/pdf"
              title="French PDF" />

author

    Indicates the referenced document provides further information about
    the author of the current document or article. Relevant for <link>,
    <a>, and <area> elements.

    With <a> and <area>, it indicates the linked document (or mailto:)
    provides information about the author of the nearest <article>
    ancestor if there is one, otherwise the entire document.

    With <link>, it represents the author of the entire document.

    Note: For historical reasons, the obsolete attribute value
    rev="made" is treated as rel="author".

bookmark

    Relevant as the rel attribute value for the <a> and <area> elements.
    Gives a permalink for the nearest ancestor <article> element, if
    there is one. If there is no ancestor <article> element, gives a
    permalink for the section the linking element is most closely
    associated with.

canonical

    Valid for <link>, it defines the preferred URL for the current
    document, which helps search engines reduce duplicate content.

dns-prefetch

    Relevant for the <link> element both in the <body> and <head>, it
    tells the browser to preemptively perform DNS resolution for the
    target resource's origin. Useful for resources the user will likely
    need, it helps reduce latency and thereby improves performance when
    the user does access the resources as the browser preemptively
    performed DNS resolution for the origin of the specified resource.
    See dns-prefetch described in resource hints.

external

    Relevant to <form>, <a>, and <area>, it indicates the referenced
    document is not part of the current site. This can be used with
    attribute selectors to style external links in a way that indicates
    to the user that they will be leaving the current site.

help

    Relevant to <form>, <link>, <a>, and <area>, the help keyword
    indicates that the linked to content provides context-sensitive
    help, providing information for the parent of the element defining
    the hyperlink, and its children. When used within <link>, the help
    is for the whole document. When included with <a> and <area> and
    supported, the default cursor will be help instead of pointer.

icon

    Valid with <link>, the linked resource represents the icon, a
    resource for representing the page in the user interface, for the
    current document.

    The most common use for the icon value is the favicon:

    html

        <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />

    If there are multiple <link rel="icon">s, the browser uses their
    media, type, and sizes attributes to select the most appropriate
    icon. If several icons are equally appropriate, the last one is
    used. If the most appropriate icon is later found to be
    inappropriate, for example because it uses an unsupported format,
    the browser proceeds to the next-most appropriate, and so on.

    Note: The crossorigin attribute is not supported for rel="icon" in
    Chromium-based browsers. See the open Chromium issue.

    Note: Apple's iOS does not use this link type, nor the sizes
    attribute, like others mobile browsers do, to select a webpage icon
    for Web Clip or a start-up placeholder. Instead it uses the
    non-standard apple-touch-icon and apple-touch-startup-image
    respectively.

    Note: The shortcut link type is often seen before icon, but this
    link type is non-conforming, ignored and web authors must not use it
    anymore.

license

    Valid on the <a>, <area>, <form>, <link> elements, the license value
    indicates that the hyperlink leads to a document describing the
    licensing information; that the main content of the current document
    is covered by the copyright license described by the referenced
    document. If not inside the <head> element, the standard doesn't
    distinguish between a hyperlink applying to a specific part of the
    document or to the document as a whole. Only the data on the page
    can indicate this.

    html

        <link rel="license" href="#license" />

    Note: Although recognized, the synonym copyright is incorrect and
    must be avoided.

manifest Experimental

    Web app manifest. Requires the use of the CORS protocol for
    cross-origin fetching.

modulepreload

    Useful for improved performance, and relevant to the <link> anywhere
    in the document, setting rel="modulepreload" tells the browser to
    preemptively fetch the script (and dependencies) and store it in the
    document's module map for later evaluation. modulepreload links can
    ensure network fetching is done with the module ready (but not
    evaluated) in the module map before it is necessarily needed. See
    also modulepreload.

next

    Relevant to <form>, <link>, <a>, and <area>, the next values
    indicates that the current document is a part of a series, and that
    the next document in the series is the referenced document. When
    included in a <link>, browsers may assume that document will be
    fetched next, and treat it as a resource hint.

nofollow

    Relevant to <form>, <a>, and <area>, the nofollow keyword tells
    search engine spiders to ignore the link relationship. The nofollow
    relationship may indicate the current document's owner does not
    endorse the referenced document. It is often included by Search
    Engine Optimizers pretending their link farms are not spam pages.

noopener

    Relevant to <form>, <a>, and <area>, creates a top-level browsing
    context that is not an auxiliary browsing context if the hyperlink
    would create either of those to begin with (i.e., has an appropriate
    target attribute value). In other words, it makes the link behave as
    if window.opener were null and target="_parent" were set.

    This is the opposite of opener.

noreferrer

    Relevant to <form>, <a>, and <area>, including this value makes the
    referrer unknown (no Referer header will be included), and creates a
    top-level browsing context as if noopener were also set.

opener

    Creates an auxiliary browsing context if the hyperlink would
    otherwise create a top-level browsing context that is not an
    auxiliary browsing context (i.e., has "_blank" as target attribute
    value). Effectively, the opposite of noopener.

pingback

    Gives the address of the pingback server that handles pingbacks to
    the current document. See the Pingback specification.

preconnect

    Provides a hint to the browser suggesting that it open a connection
    to the linked website in advance, without disclosing any private
    information or downloading any content, so that when the link is
    followed the linked content can be fetched more quickly.

prefetch

    Specifies that the user agent should preemptively fetch and cache
    the target resource as it is likely to be required for a followup
    navigation. See prefetch for more information.

preload

    Specifies that the user agent must preemptively fetch and cache the
    target resource for current navigation according to the potential
    destination given by the as attribute (and the priority associated
    with the corresponding destination). See the page for the preload
    value.

prerender Deprecated Non-standard

    Specifies that the user agent should preemptively fetch the target
    resource and process it in a way that helps deliver a faster
    response in the future, for example by fetching its subresources or
    performing some rendering.

prev

    Similar to the next keyword, relevant to <form>, <link>, <a>, and
    <area>, the prev values indicates that the current document is a
    part of a series, and that the link references a previous document
    in the series is the referenced document.

    Note: The synonym previous is incorrect and should not be used.

privacy-policy

    Valid for <a>, <area>, and <link> elements, the privacy-policy value
    indicates that the referenced document is the Privacy Policy which
    describes the data collection and usage practices of the current
    document.

search

    Relevant to <form>, <link>, <a>, and <area> elements, the search
    keywords indicates that the hyperlink references a document whose
    interface is specially designed for searching in the current
    document, site, and related resources, providing a link to a
    resource that can be used to search.

    If the type attribute is set to
    application/opensearchdescription+xml the resource is an OpenSearch
    plugin that can be easily added to the interface of Firefox.

stylesheet

    Valid for the <link> element, it imports an external resource to be
    used as a stylesheet. The type attribute is not needed as it's a
    text/css stylesheet, as that is the default value. If it's not a
    stylesheet of type text/css it is best to declare the type.

    While this attribute defines the link as being a stylesheet, the
    interaction with other attributes and other key terms within the rel
    value impact whether the stylesheet is downloaded and/or used.

    When used with the alternate keyword, it defines an alternative
    style sheet. In this case, include a non-empty title.

    The external stylesheet will not be used or even downloaded if the
    media does not match the value of the media attribute.

    Requires the use of the CORS protocol for cross-origin fetching.

tag

    Valid for the <a>, and <area> elements, it gives a tag (identified
    by the given address) that applies to the current document. The tag
    value denotes that the link refers to a document describing a tag
    applying to the document on which it is located. This link type is
    not meant for tags within a tag cloud, as those tags apply to a
    group of pages, whereas the tag value of the rel attribute is for a
    single document.

terms-of-service

    Valid for <a>, <area>, and <link> elements, the terms-of-service
    value indicates that the referenced document is the Terms of Service
    that describes the agreements between the current document's
    provider and users who wish to use the document provided.

Non-standard values

apple-touch-icon

    Specifies the icon for a web application on an iOS device.

# rel=modulepreload#

The modulepreload keyword, for the rel attribute of the <link> element,
provides a declarative way to preemptively fetch a module script, parse
and compile it, and store it in the document's module map for later
execution.

Preloading allows modules and their dependencies to be downloaded early,
and can also significantly reduce the overall download and processing
time. This is because it allows pages to fetch modules in parallel,
instead of sequentially as each module is processed and its dependencies
are discovered. Note however that you can't just preload everything!
What you choose to preload must be balanced against other operations
that might then be starved, adversely affecting user experience.

Links with rel="modulepreload" are similar to those with rel="preload".
The main difference is that preload just downloads the file and stores
it in the cache, while modulepreload gets the module, parses and
compiles it, and puts the results into the module map so that it is
ready to execute.

When using modulepreload the fetch request mode is always cors, and the
crossorigin property is used to determine the request credential mode.
If crossorigin is set to anonymous or "" (default), then the credentials
mode is same-origin, and user credentials such as cookies and
authentication are only sent for requests with the same-origin. If
crossorigin is set to use-credentials then the credentials mode is
include, and user credentials for both single- and cross-origin
requests.

The as attribute is optional for links with rel="modulepreload", and
defaults to "script". It can be set to "script" or any script-like
destination, such as "audioworklet", "paintworklet", "serviceworker",
"sharedworker", or "worker". An Event named "error" is fired on the
element if any other destination is used.

A browser may additionally also choose to automatically fetch any
dependencies of the module resource. Note however that this is a
browser-specific optimization — the only approach to ensure that all
browsers will try to preload a module's dependencies is to individually
specify them! Further, the events named load or error fire immediately
following success or failure of loading the specified resources. If
dependencies are automatically fetched, no additional events are fired
in the main thread (although you might monitor additional requests in a
service worker or on the server).

Examples

Consider the basic-modules example (live version), introduced in the
JavaScript modules guide.

This has a file structure as shown below, consisting of the top level
module main.js, which statically imports two dependency modules
modules/canvas.js and modules/square.js using the import statement.

    index.html
    main.js
    modules/
        canvas.js
        square.js

The HTML for the example below shows how main.js is fetched in a
<script> element. Only after main.js has loaded does the browser
discover and fetch the two dependency modules.

html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Basic JavaScript module example</title>
        <style>
          canvas {
            border: 1px solid black;
          }
        </style>
        <script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body></body>
    </html>

The HTML below updates the example to use <link> elements with
rel="modulepreload" for the main file and each of the dependency
modules. This is much faster because the three modules all start
downloading asynchronously and in parallel before they are needed. By
the time main.js has been parsed and its dependencies are known, they
have already been fetched and downloaded.

html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Basic JavaScript module example</title>
        <link rel="modulepreload" href="main.js" />
        <link rel="modulepreload" href="modules/canvas.js" />
        <link rel="modulepreload" href="modules/square.js" />
        <style>
          canvas {
            border: 1px solid black;
          }
        </style>

        <script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body></body>
    </html>

# rel=noopener#

The noopener keyword for the rel attribute of the <a>, <area>, and
<form> elements instructs the browser to navigate to the target resource
without granting the new browsing context access to the document that
opened it — by not setting the Window.opener property on the opened
window (it returns null).

This is especially useful when opening untrusted links, in order to
ensure they cannot tamper with the originating document via the
Window.opener property (see About rel=noopener for more details), while
still providing the Referer HTTP header (unless noreferrer is used as
well).

Note that when noopener is used, nonempty target names other than _top,
_self, and _parent are all treated like _blank in terms of deciding
whether to open a new window/tab.

Note: Setting target="_blank" on <a> elements now implicitly provides
the same rel behavior as setting rel="noopener" which does not set
window.opener. See browser compatibility for support status.

# rel=preconnect#

The preconnect keyword for the rel attribute of the <link> element is a
hint to browsers that the user is likely to need resources from the
target resource's origin, and therefore the browser can likely improve
the user experience by preemptively initiating a connection to that
origin. Preconnecting speeds up future loads from a given origin by
preemptively performing part or all of the handshake (DNS+TCP for HTTP,
and DNS+TCP+TLS for HTTPS origins).

<link rel="preconnect"> will provide a benefit to any future
cross-origin HTTP request, navigation or subresource. It has no benefit
on same-origin requests because the connection is already open.

If a page needs to make connections to many third-party domains,
preconnecting them all can be counterproductive. The
<link rel="preconnect"> hint is best used for only the most critical
connections. For the others, just use <link rel="dns-prefetch"> to save
time on the first step — the DNS lookup.

Examples

html

    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com" />

You can also implement preconnect as an HTTP Link header, for example:

http

    Link: <https://example.com>; rel="preconnect"

# rel=prefetch#

The prefetch keyword for the rel attribute of the <link> element
provides a hint to browsers that the user is likely to need the target
resource for future navigations, and therefore the browser can likely
improve the user experience by preemptively fetching and caching the
resource. <link rel="prefetch"> is used for same-site navigation
resources, or for subresources used by same-site pages.

The result is kept in the HTTP cache on disk. Because of this it is
useful for prefetching subresources, even if they are not used by the
current page. You could also use it to prefetch the next document the
user will likely visit on the site. However, as a result you need to be
careful with headers — for example certain Cache-Control headers could
block prefetching (for example no-cache or no-store).

Note: Because of such limitations, you are advised to use the
Speculation Rules API for document prefetches instead, where it is
supported.

<link rel="prefetch"> is functionally equivalent to a fetch() call with
a priority: "low" option set on it, except that the former will
generally have an even lower priority, and it will have a
Sec-Purpose: prefetch header set on the request. Note that in general
browsers will give prefetch resources a lower priority than preload ones
(e.g. requested via <link rel="preload">) — the current page is more
important than the next.

The fetch request for a prefetch operation results in an HTTP request
that includes the HTTP header Sec-Purpose: prefetch. A server might use
this header to change the cache timeouts for the resources, or perform
other special handling. The request will also include the Sec-Fetch-Dest
header with the value set to empty.

The Accept header in the request will match the value used for normal
navigation requests. This allows the browser to find the matching cached
resources following navigation.

Examples

Basic prefetch

js

    <link rel="prefetch" href="main.js" />

Navigation and subresource prefetches

Prefetching can be used to fetch both HTML and sub-resources for a
possible next navigation. A common use case is to have a simple website
landing page that fetches more "heavy-weight" resources used by the rest
of the site.

html

    <link rel="prefetch" href="/app/style.css" />
    <link rel="prefetch" href="/landing-page" />

The effects of cache partitioning

Many browsers now implement some form of cache partitioning, which makes
<link rel="prefetch"> useless for resources intended for use by
different top-level sites. This includes the main document when
navigating cross-site. So, for example, the following prefetch:

html

    <link rel="prefetch" href="https://news.example/article" />

Would not be accessible from https://aggregator.example/.

# rel=preload#

The preload value of the <link> element's rel attribute lets you declare
fetch requests in the HTML's <head>, specifying resources that your page
will need very soon, which you want to start loading early in the page
lifecycle, before browsers' main rendering machinery kicks in. This
ensures they are available earlier and are less likely to block the
page's render, improving performance. Even though the name contains the
term load, it doesn't load and execute the script but only schedules it
to be downloaded and cached with a higher priority.

The basics

You most commonly use <link> to load a CSS file to style your page with:

html

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css" />

Here however, we will use a rel value of preload, which turns <link>
into a preloader for any resource we want. You will also need to
specify:

-   The path to the resource in the href attribute.
-   The type of resource in the as attribute.

A simple example might look like this (see our JS and CSS example
source, and also live):

html

    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <title>JS and CSS preload example</title>

      <link rel="preload" href="style.css" as="style" />
      <link rel="preload" href="main.js" as="script" />

      <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    </head>

    <body>
      <h1>bouncing balls</h1>
      <canvas></canvas>

      <script src="main.js" defer></script>
    </body>

Here we preload our CSS and JavaScript files so they will be available
as soon as they are required for the rendering of the page later on.
This example is trivial, as the browser probably discovers the
<link rel="stylesheet"> and <script> elements in the same chunk of HTML
as the preloads, but the benefits can be seen much more clearly the
later resources are discovered and the larger they are. For example:

-   Resources that are pointed to from inside CSS, like fonts or images.
-   Resources that JavaScript can request, like JSON, imported scripts,
    or web workers.
-   Larger images and video files.

preload has other advantages too. Using as to specify the type of
content to be preloaded allows the browser to:

-   Prioritize resource loading more accurately.
-   Store in the cache for future requests, reusing the resource if
    appropriate.
-   Apply the correct content security policy to the resource.
-   Set the correct Accept request headers for it.

What types of content can be preloaded?

Many content types can be preloaded. The possible as attribute values
are:

-   audio: Audio file, as typically used in <audio>.
-   document: An HTML document intended to be embedded by a <frame> or
    <iframe>.
-   embed: A resource to be embedded inside an <embed> element.
-   fetch: Resource to be accessed by a fetch or XHR request, such as an
    ArrayBuffer, WebAssembly binary, or JSON file.
-   font: Font file.
-   image: Image file.
-   object: A resource to be embedded inside an <object> element.
-   script: JavaScript file.
-   style: CSS stylesheet.
-   track: WebVTT file.
-   worker: A JavaScript web worker or shared worker.
-   video: Video file, as typically used in <video>.

Note: font and fetch preloading requires the crossorigin attribute to be
set; see CORS-enabled fetches below.

Note: There's more detail about these values and the web features they
expect to be consumed by in the Preload spec — see link element
extensions. Also note that the full list of values the as attribute can
take is governed by the Fetch spec — see request destinations.

Including a MIME type

<link> elements can accept a type attribute, which contains the MIME
type of the resource the element points to. This is especially useful
when preloading resources — the browser will use the type attribute
value to work out if it supports that resource, and will only download
it if so, ignoring it if not.

You can see an example of this in our video example (see the full source
code, and also the live version), a code snippet from which is shown
below. This illustrates the core behavior behind preloading in general.

html

    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <title>Video preload example</title>

      <link rel="preload" href="sintel-short.mp4" as="video" type="video/mp4" />
    </head>
    <body>
      <video controls>
        <source src="sintel-short.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        <source src="sintel-short.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <p>
          Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
          <a href="sintel-short.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
        </p>
      </video>
    </body>

The code in the example above causes the video/mp4 video to be preloaded
only in supporting browsers — and for users who have video/mp4 support
in their browsers, causes the video/mp4 video to actually be used (since
it's the first <source> specified). That makes the video player
hopefully smoother/more responsive for users who have video/mp4 support
in their browsers.

Note that for users whose browsers have both video/mp4 and video/webm
support, if in that code a
<link rel="preload" href="sintel-short.webm" as="video" type="video/webm">
element were also specified, then both the video/mp4 and video/webm
videos would be preloaded — even though only one of them would actually
be used.

Therefore, specifying preloading for multiple types of the same resource
is discouraged. Instead, the best practice is to specify preloading only
for the type the majority of your users are likely to actually use.
That's why the code in the example above doesn't specify preloading for
the video/webm video.

However, the lack of preloading doesn't prevent the video/webm video
from actually being used by those who need it: for users whose browsers
don't have video/mp4 support but do have video/webm support, the code in
the example above does still cause the video/webm video to be used — but
it does so without also causing it to also be preloaded unnecessarily
for the majority of other users.

CORS-enabled fetches

When preloading resources that are fetched with CORS enabled (e.g.
fetch(), XMLHttpRequest or fonts), special care needs to be taken to
setting the crossorigin attribute on your <link> element. The attribute
needs to be set to match the resource's CORS and credentials mode, even
when the fetch is not cross-origin.

As mentioned above, one interesting case where this applies is font
files. Because of various reasons, these have to be fetched using
anonymous-mode CORS (see Font fetching requirements).

Let's use this case as an example. You can see the full example source
code on GitHub (also see it live):

html

    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <title>Web font example</title>

      <link
        rel="preload"
        href="fonts/cicle_fina-webfont.woff2"
        as="font"
        type="font/woff2"
        crossorigin />
      <link
        rel="preload"
        href="fonts/zantroke-webfont.woff2"
        as="font"
        type="font/woff2"
        crossorigin />

      <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    </head>
    <body>
      …
    </body>

Not only are we providing the MIME type hints in the type attributes,
but we are also providing the crossorigin attribute to make sure the
preload's CORS mode matches the eventual font resource request.

Including media

One nice feature of <link> elements is their ability to accept media
attributes. These can accept media types or full-blown media queries,
allowing you to do responsive preloading!

Let's look at an example (see it on GitHub — source code, live example):

html

    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <title>Responsive preload example</title>

      <link
        rel="preload"
        href="bg-image-narrow.png"
        as="image"
        media="(max-width: 600px)" />
      <link
        rel="preload"
        href="bg-image-wide.png"
        as="image"
        media="(min-width: 601px)" />

      <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
      <header>
        <h1>My site</h1>
      </header>

      <script>
        const mediaQueryList = window.matchMedia("(max-width: 600px)");
        const header = document.querySelector("header");

        if (mediaQueryList.matches) {
          header.style.backgroundImage = "url(bg-image-narrow.png)";
        } else {
          header.style.backgroundImage = "url(bg-image-wide.png)";
        }
      </script>
    </body>

We include media attributes on our <link> elements so that a narrow
image is preloaded if the user has a narrow viewport, and a wider image
is loaded if they have a wide viewport. We use Window.matchMedia /
MediaQueryList to do this (see Testing media queries for more).

This makes it much more likely that the font will be available for the
page render, cutting down on FOUT (flash of unstyled text).

This doesn't have to be limited to images, or even files of the same
type — think big! You could perhaps preload and display a simple SVG
diagram if the user is on a narrow screen where bandwidth and CPU is
potentially more limited, or preload a complex chunk of JavaScript then
use it to render an interactive 3D model if the user's resources are
more plentiful.

Scripting and preloads

Note: Use <link rel="modulepreload"> instead if you are working with
JavaScript modules.

Another nice thing about these preloads is that you can execute them
with script. For example, here we create a HTMLLinkElement instance,
then attach it to the DOM:

js

    const preloadLink = document.createElement("link");
    preloadLink.href = "myscript.js";
    preloadLink.rel = "preload";
    preloadLink.as = "script";
    document.head.appendChild(preloadLink);

This means that the browser will preload the myscript.js file, but not
actually use it yet. To use it, you could do this:

js

    const preloadedScript = document.createElement("script");
    preloadedScript.src = "myscript.js";
    document.body.appendChild(preloadedScript);

This is useful when you want to preload a script, but then defer
execution until exactly when you need it.

# rel=prerender#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

Non-standard: This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards
track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not
work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between
implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

The prerender keyword for the rel attribute of the <link> element is a
hint to browsers that the user might need the target resource for the
next navigation, and therefore the browser can likely improve the user
experience by preemptively fetching and processing the resource — for
example, by fetching its subresources or performing some rendering in
the background offscreen.

This feature is superceded by the Speculation Rules API.

# HTML attribute: required#

The Boolean required attribute, if present, indicates that the user must
specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted.

The required attribute is supported by text, search, url, tel, email,
password, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, checkbox,
radio, file, <input> types along with the <select> and <textarea> form
control elements. If present on any of these input types and elements,
the :required pseudo class will match. If the attribute is not included,
the :optional pseudo class will match.

The attribute is not supported or relevant to range and color, as both
have default values. It is also not supported on hidden as it can not be
expected that a user to fill out a form that is hidden. Nor is it
supported on any of the button types, including image.

Note color and range don't support required as both always have a value.
Type color defaults to #000000. The default for range is the midpoint
between min and max — with min and max defaulting to 0 and 100
respectively in most browsers if not declared.

In the case of a same named group of radio buttons, if a single radio
button in the group has the required attribute, a radio button in that
group must be checked, although it doesn't have to be the one on which
the attribute is applied. To improve code maintenance, it is recommended
to either include the required attribute in every same-named radio
button in the group, or else in none.

In the case of a same named group of checkbox input types, only the
checkboxes with the required attribute are required.

Note: Setting aria-required="true" tells a screen reader that an element
(any element) is required, but has no bearing on the optionality of the
element.

Attribute interactions

Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not have
any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

Usability

When including the required attribute, provide a visible indication near
the control informing the user that the <input>, <select> or <textarea>
is required. In addition, target required form controls with the
:required pseudo-class, styling them in a way to indicate they are
required. This improves usability for sighted users. Assistive
technology should inform the user that the form control is mandatory
based on the required attribute, but adding aria-required="true" doesn't
hurt, in case the browser / screen reader combination does not support
required yet.

Constraint validation

If the element is required and the element's value is the empty string,
then the element is suffering from valueMissing and the element will
match the :invalid pseudo class.

Accessibility concerns

Provide an indication to users informing them the form control is
required. Ensure the messaging is multi-faceted, such as through text,
color, markings, and attribute, so that all users understand the
requirements whether they have color blindness, cognitive differences,
or are using a screen reader.

# HTML attribute: size#

The size attribute defines the width of the <input> and the height of
the <select> element. For the input, if the type attribute is text or
password then it's the number of characters. This must be an integer
value of 0 or higher. If no size is specified, or an invalid value is
specified, the input has no size declared, and the form control will be
the default width based on the user agent. If CSS targets the element
with properties impacting the width, CSS takes precedence.

The size attribute has no impact on constraint validation.

# HTML attribute: step#

The step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the
value must adhere to or the keyword any. It is valid for the numeric
input types, including the date, month, week, time, datetime-local,
number and range types.

The step sets the stepping interval when clicking up and down spinner
buttons, moving a slider left and right on a range, and validating the
different date types. If not explicitly included, step defaults to 1 for
number and range, and 1 unit type (minute, week, month, day) for the
date/time input types. The value must be a positive number - integer or
float — or the special value any, which means no stepping is implied and
any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max).

The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only
integers to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer. The
default stepping value for time is 1 second, with 900 being equal to 15
minutes.

Syntax

  Input type       Value          Example
  ---------------- -------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
  date             1 (day)        <input type="date" min="2019-12-25" step="1">
  month            1 (month)      <input type="month" min="2019-12" step="12">
  week             1 (week)       <input type="week" min="2019-W23" step="2">
  time             60 (seconds)   <input type="time" min="09:00" step="900">
  datetime-local   1 (second)     <input type="datetime-local" min="2019-12-25T19:30" step="7">
  number           1              <input type="number" min="0" step="0.1" max="10">
  range            1              <input type="range" min="0" step="2" max="10">

  : Default values for step

If any is not explicitly set, valid values for the number, date/time
input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for stepping -
the min value and increments of the step value, up to the max value, if
specified. The following example results in any even integer, 10 or
greater, being valid:

html

    <input type="number" min="10" step="2" />

If step is omitted, any integer is valid but floats like 4.2 are not
valid as step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid:

-   either step would have to be set to any, 0.1, or 0.2,
-   or the min value would have to be a number ending in .2, such as
    0.2, 1.2, or -5.2.

Examples

min impact on step

The value of min defines valid values, even if the step attribute is not
included. This is because step defaults to 1.

In this example, we add a big red border around invalid inputs:

css

    input:invalid {
      border: solid red 3px;
    }

We then define an input with a minimum value of 1.2 and a step value of
2:

html

    <input id="myNumber" name="myNumber" type="number" step="2" min="1.2" />

Valid values include 1.2, 3.2, 5.2, 7.2, 9.2, 11.2, and so on. Only
floats with an odd-numbered integer part and a decimal part of .2 are
valid. The number spinner, if present, generates valid float values of
1.2 and greater, in increments of 2.

Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping
configuration, the value is considered invalid in constraint validation
and will match the :invalid and :out-of-range pseudoclasses.

See Client-side validation and stepMismatch for more information.

Accessibility concerns

Provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form
and use individual form controls. Indicate any required and optional
input, data formats, and other relevant information. When using the min
attribute, ensure this minimum requirement is understood by the user.
Providing instructions within the <label> may be sufficient. If
providing instructions outside of labels, which allows more flexible
positioning and design, consider using aria-labelledby or
aria-describedby.

# Block-level content#

In CSS, content that participates in block layout is called block-level
content.

In a block layout, boxes are laid out one after the other, vertically,
beginning at the top of a containing block. Each box's left outer edge
touches the left edge of the containing block.
A block-level element always starts on a new line. In horizontal writing
modes, like English or Arabic, it occupies the entire horizontal space
of its parent element (container) and vertical space equal to the height
of its contents, thereby creating a "block".

Note: The above behavior of block layout changes if the containing
block's writing-mode is set to value other than the default value.

Note: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) elements historically were
categorized as either "block-level" elements or "inline" elements. As a
presentational characteristic, this is now specified by CSS.

Examples

In this example, two paragraph (<p>) elements are put in a <div>.

html

    <div>
      <p>
        This the first paragraph. The background color of these paragraphs have been
        colored to distinguish them from their parent element.
      </p>
      <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
    </div>

The paragraph(<p>) elements are block-level by default. That is why they
are displayed in block layout:

    p {
      background-color: #8abb55;
    }

# Constraint validation#

The creation of web forms has always been a complex task. While marking
up the form itself is easy, checking whether each field has a valid and
coherent value is more difficult, and informing the user about the
problem may become a headache. HTML5 introduced new mechanisms for
forms: it added new semantic types for the <input> element and
constraint validation to ease the work of checking the form content on
the client side. Basic, usual constraints can be checked, without the
need for JavaScript, by setting new attributes; more complex constraints
can be tested using the Constraint Validation API.

For a basic introduction to these concepts, with examples, see the Form
validation tutorial.

Note: HTML Constraint validation doesn't remove the need for validation
on the server side. Even though far fewer invalid form requests are to
be expected, invalid ones can still be sent such as by bad people trying
to trick your web application. Therefore, you need to always also
validate input constraints on the server side, in a way that is
consistent with what is done on the client side.

Intrinsic and basic constraints

In HTML, basic constraints are declared in two ways:

-   By choosing the most semantically appropriate value for the type
    attribute of the <input> element, e.g., choosing the email type
    automatically creates a constraint that checks whether the value is
    a valid email address.
-   By setting values on validation-related attributes, allowing basic
    constraints to be described in a simple way, without the need for
    JavaScript.

Semantic input types

The intrinsic constraints for the type attribute are:

  Input type             Constraint description                                                                                                                                         Associated violation
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  <input type="URL">     The value must be an absolute URL, as defined in the URL Living Standard.                                                                                      TypeMismatch constraint violation
  <input type="email">   The value must be a syntactically valid email address, which generally has the format username@hostname.tld but can also be local such as username@hostname.   TypeMismatch constraint violation

For both of these input types, if the multiple attribute is set, several
values can be set, as a comma-separated list. If any of these do not
satisfy the condition described here, the Type mismatch constraint
violation is triggered.

Note that most input types don't have intrinsic constraints, as some are
barred from constraint validation or have a sanitization algorithm
transforming incorrect values to a correct default.

Validation-related attributes

In addition to the type attribute described above, the following
attributes are used to describe basic constraints:

  Attribute   Input types supporting the attribute                                                                                                                            Possible values                                                                                        Constraint description                                                                                                                                                                                Associated violation

Constraint validation process

Constraint validation is done through the Constraint Validation API
either on a single form element or at the form level, on the <form>
element itself. The constraint validation is done in the following ways:

-   By a call to the checkValidity() or reportValidity() method of a
    form-associated DOM interface, (HTMLInputElement, HTMLSelectElement,
    HTMLButtonElement, HTMLOutputElement or HTMLTextAreaElement), which
    evaluates the constraints only on this element, allowing a script to
    get this information. The checkValidity() method returns a Boolean
    indicating whether the element's value passes its constraints. (This
    is typically done by the user-agent when determining which of the
    CSS pseudo-classes, :valid or :invalid, applies.) In contrast, the
    reportValidity() method reports any constraint failures to the user.
-   By a call to the checkValidity() or reportValidity() method on the
    HTMLFormElement interface.
-   By submitting the form itself.

Calling checkValidity() is called statically validating the constraints,
while calling reportValidity() or submitting the form is called
interactively validating the constraints.

Note:

-   If the novalidate attribute is set on the <form> element,
    interactive validation of the constraints doesn't happen.
-   Calling the submit() method on the HTMLFormElement interface doesn't
    trigger a constraint validation. In other words, this method sends
    the form data to the server even if it doesn't satisfy the
    constraints. Call the click() method on a submit button instead.

Complex constraints using the Constraint Validation API

Using JavaScript and the Constraint API, it is possible to implement
more complex constraints, for example, constraints combining several
fields, or constraints involving complex calculations.

Basically, the idea is to trigger JavaScript on some form field event
(like onchange) to calculate whether the constraint is violated, and
then to use the method field.setCustomValidity() to set the result of
the validation: an empty string means the constraint is satisfied, and
any other string means there is an error and this string is the error
message to display to the user.

Constraint combining several fields: Postal code validation

The postal code format varies from one country to another. Not only do
most countries allow an optional prefix with the country code (like D-
in Germany, F- in France or Switzerland), but some countries have postal
codes with only a fixed number of digits; others, like the UK, have more
complex structures, allowing letters at some specific positions.

Note: This is not a comprehensive postal code validation library, but
rather a demonstration of the key concepts.

As an example, we will add a script checking the constraint validation
for this simple form:

html

    <form>
      <label for="ZIP">ZIP : </label>
      <input type="text" id="ZIP" />
      <label for="Country">Country : </label>
      <select id="Country">
        <option value="ch">Switzerland</option>
        <option value="fr">France</option>
        <option value="de">Germany</option>
        <option value="nl">The Netherlands</option>
      </select>
      <input type="submit" value="Validate" />
    </form>

This displays the following form:

First, we write a function checking the constraint itself:

js

    function checkZIP() {
      // For each country, defines the pattern that the ZIP has to follow
      const constraints = {
        ch: [
          "^(CH-)?\\d{4}$",
          "Switzerland ZIPs must have exactly 4 digits: e.g. CH-1950 or 1950",
        ],
        fr: [
          "^(F-)?\\d{5}$",
          "France ZIPs must have exactly 5 digits: e.g. F-75012 or 75012",
        ],
        de: [
          "^(D-)?\\d{5}$",
          "Germany ZIPs must have exactly 5 digits: e.g. D-12345 or 12345",
        ],
        nl: [
          "^(NL-)?\\d{4}\\s*([A-RT-Z][A-Z]|S[BCE-RT-Z])$",
          "Netherland ZIPs must have exactly 4 digits, followed by 2 letters except SA, SD and SS",
        ],
      };

      // Read the country id
      const country = document.getElementById("Country").value;

      // Get the NPA field
      const ZIPField = document.getElementById("ZIP");

      // Build the constraint checker
      const constraint = new RegExp(constraints[country][0], "");
      console.log(constraint);

      // Check it!
      if (constraint.test(ZIPField.value)) {
        // The ZIP follows the constraint, we use the ConstraintAPI to tell it
        ZIPField.setCustomValidity("");
      } else {
        // The ZIP doesn't follow the constraint, we use the ConstraintAPI to
        // give a message about the format required for this country
        ZIPField.setCustomValidity(constraints[country][1]);
      }
    }

Then we link it to the onchange event for the <select> and the oninput
event for the <input>:

js

    window.onload = () => {
      document.getElementById("Country").onchange = checkZIP;
      document.getElementById("ZIP").oninput = checkZIP;
    };

Limiting the size of a file before its upload

Another common constraint is to limit the size of a file to be uploaded.
Checking this on the client side before the file is transmitted to the
server requires combining the Constraint Validation API, and especially
the field.setCustomValidity() method, with another JavaScript API, here
the File API.

Here is the HTML part:

html

    <label for="FS">Select a file smaller than 75 kB : </label>
    <input type="file" id="FS" />

This displays:

The JavaScript reads the file selected, uses the File.size() method to
get its size, compares it to the (hard coded) limit, and calls the
Constraint API to inform the browser if there is a violation:

js

    function checkFileSize() {
      const FS = document.getElementById("FS");
      const files = FS.files;

      // If there is (at least) one file selected
      if (files.length > 0) {
        if (files[0].size > 75 * 1024) {
          // Check the constraint
          FS.setCustomValidity("The selected file must not be larger than 75 kB");
          return;
        }
      }
      // No custom constraint violation
      FS.setCustomValidity("");
    }

Finally, we hook the method with the correct event:

js

    window.onload = () => {
      document.getElementById("FS").onchange = checkFileSize;
    };

Visual styling of constraint validation

Apart from setting constraints, web developers want to control what
messages are displayed to the users and how they are styled.

Controlling the look of elements

The look of elements can be controlled via CSS pseudo-classes.

:required and :optional CSS pseudo-classes

The :required and :optional pseudo-classes allow writing selectors that
match form elements that have the required attribute, or that don't have
it.

:placeholder-shown CSS pseudo-class

See :placeholder-shown.

:valid :invalid CSS pseudo-classes

The :valid and :invalid pseudo-classes are used to represent <input>
elements whose content validates and fails to validate respectively
according to the input's type setting. These classes allow the user to
style valid or invalid form elements to make it easier to identify
elements that are either formatted correctly or incorrectly.

Controlling the text of constraint violation

The following items can help with controlling the text of a constraint
violation:

-   The setCustomValidity(message) method on the following elements:
    -   <fieldset>. Note: Setting a custom validity message on fieldset
        elements will not prevent form submission in most browsers.
    -   <input>
    -   <output>
    -   <select>
    -   Submit buttons (created with either a <button> element with the
        submit type, or an input element with the submit type. Other
        types of buttons do not participate in constraint validation.
    -   <textarea>
-   The ValidityState interface describes the object returned by the
    validity property of the element types listed above. It represents
    various ways that an entered value can be invalid. Together, they
    help explain why an element's value fails to validate, if it's not
    valid.

# Content categories#

Most HTML elements are a member of one or more content categories —
these categories group elements that share common characteristics. This
is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among
elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the
categories' shared behavior and their associated rules, especially when
you come upon their intricate details. It's also possible for elements
to not be a member of any of these categories.

There are three types of content categories:

-   Main content categories, which describe common rules shared by many
    elements.
-   Form-related content categories, which describe rules common to
    form-related elements.
-   Specific content categories, which describe rare categories shared
    only by a few elements, sometimes only in a specific context.

Note: A more detailed discussion of these content categories and their
comparative functionalities is beyond the scope of this article; for
that, you may wish to read the relevant portions of the HTML
specification.

to other documents, or convey other out-of-band information.

Elements belonging to this category are <base>, <link>, <meta>,
<noscript>, <script>, <style> and <title>.

Flow content

Flow content is a broad category that encompasses most elements that can
go inside the <body> element, including heading elements, sectioning
elements, phrasing elements, embedding elements, interactive elements,
and form-related elements. It also includes text nodes (but not those
that only consist of white space characters).

The flow elements are:

-   <a>
-   <abbr>
-   <address>
-   <article>
-   <aside>
-   <audio>
-   <b>
-   <bdo>

A few other elements belong to this category, but only if a specific
condition is fulfilled:

-   <area>, if it is a descendant of a <map> element
-   <link>, if the itemprop attribute is present
-   <meta>, if the itemprop attribute is present
-   <style>, if the scoped Deprecated attribute is present

Sectioning content

Sectioning content, a subset of flow content, creates a section in the
current outline defining the scope of <header> and <footer> elements.

Elements belonging to this category are <article>, <aside>, <nav>, and
<section>.

Heading content

Heading content, a subset of flow content, defines the title of a
section. This definition applies both to sections marked by an explicit
sectioning content elements and to those implicitly defined by the
heading content itself.

Elements belonging to this category are <h1>-<h6> and <hgroup>.

Note: Though likely to contain heading content, the <header> is not
heading content itself.

Note: The <hgroup> element is not recommended as it does not work
properly with assistive technologies. It was removed from the W3C HTML
specification prior to HTML 5 being finalized, but is still part of the
WHATWG specification and is at least partially supported by most
browsers.

Phrasing content

Phrasing content, a subset of flow content, refers to the text and the
markup within a document. Sequences of phrasing content make up
paragraphs.

Elements belonging to this category are:

-   <abbr>
-   <audio>
-   <b>
-   <bdi>
-   <bdo>
-   <br>
-   <button>

-   <u>
-   <var>
-   <video>
-   <wbr>
-   plain text (including more than just whitespace characters)

A few other elements belong to this category, but only if a specific
condition is fulfilled:

-   <a>, if it contains only phrasing content
-   <area>, if it is a descendant of a <map> element
-   <del>, if it contains only phrasing content
-   <ins>, if it contains only phrasing content
-   <link>, if the itemprop attribute is present
-   <map>, if it contains only phrasing content
-   <meta>, if the itemprop attribute is present

Embedded content

Embedded content, a subset of flow content, imports another resource or
inserts content from another markup language or namespace into the
document. Elements that belong to this category include:

-   <audio>
-   <canvas>
-   <embed>
-   <iframe>
-   <img>
-   <math>
-   <object>
-   <picture>
-   <svg>
-   <video>

Interactive content

Interactive content, a subset of flow content, includes elements that
are specifically designed for user interaction. Elements that belong to
this category include:

-   <button>
-   <details>
-   <embed>
-   <iframe>
-   <label>
-   <select>
-   <textarea>

Some elements belong to this category only under specific conditions:

-   <a>, if the href attribute is present
-   <audio>, if the controls attribute is present
-   <img>, if the usemap attribute is present
-   <input>, if the type attribute is not in the hidden state
-   <object>, if the usemap attribute is present
-   <video>, if the controls attribute is present

Palpable content

Content is palpable when it's neither empty nor hidden; it is content
that is rendered and is substantive. Elements whose model is flow
content should have at least one node which is palpable.

Form-associated content

Form-associated content is a subset of flow content comprising elements
that have a form owner, exposed by a form attribute, and can be used
everywhere flow content is expected. A form owner is either the
containing <form> element or the element whose id is specified in the
form attribute.

-   <button>
-   <fieldset>
-   <input>
-   <label>
-   <meter>
-   <object>
-   <output>
-   <progress>
-   <select>
-   <textarea>

This category contains several sub-categories:

listed

    Elements that are listed in the form.elements and fieldset.elements
    collections. Contains <button>, <fieldset>, <input>, <object>,
    <output>, <select>, and <textarea>.

labelable

    Elements that can be associated with <label> elements. Contains
    <button>, <input>, <meter>, <output>, <progress>, <select>, and
    <textarea>.

submittable

    Elements that can be used for constructing the form data set when
    the form is submitted. Contains <button>, <input>, <object>,
    <select>, and <textarea>.

resettable

    Elements that can be affected when a form is reset. Contains
    <input>, <output>, <select>, and <textarea>.

Secondary content categories

There are some secondary classifications of elements that can be useful
to be aware of as well.

Script-supporting elements

Script-supporting elements are elements which don't directly contribute
to the rendered output of a document. Instead, they serve to support
scripts, either by containing or specifying script code directly, or by
specifying data that will be used by scripts.

The script-supporting elements are:

-   <script>
-   <template>

Transparent content model

If an element has a transparent content model, then its contents must be
structured such that they would be valid HTML 5, even if the transparent
element were removed and replaced by the child elements.

For example, the <del> and <ins> elements are transparent:

html

    <p>
      We hold these truths to be <del><em>sacred &amp; undeniable</em></del>
      <ins>self-evident</ins>.
    </p>

If those elements were removed, this fragment would still be valid HTML
(if not correct English).

html

    <p>We hold these truths to be <em>sacred &amp; undeniable</em> self-evident.</p>

# Allowing cross-origin use of images and canvas#

HTML provides a crossorigin attribute for images that, in combination
with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img>
element that are loaded from foreign origins to be used in a <canvas> as
if they had been loaded from the current origin.

See CORS settings attributes for details on how the crossorigin
attribute is used.

Security and tainted canvases

Because the pixels in a canvas's bitmap can come from a variety of
sources, including images or videos retrieved from other hosts, it's
inevitable that security problems may arise.

As soon as you draw into a canvas any data that was loaded from another
origin without CORS approval, the canvas becomes tainted. A tainted
canvas is one which is no longer considered secure, and any attempts to
retrieve image data back from the canvas will cause an exception to be
thrown.

If the source of the foreign content is an HTML <img> or SVG <svg>
element, attempting to retrieve the contents of the canvas isn't
allowed.

If the foreign content comes from an image obtained from either as
HTMLCanvasElement or ImageBitMap, and the image source doesn't meet the
same origin rules, attempts to read the canvas's contents are blocked.

Calling any of the following on a tainted canvas will result in an
error:

-   Calling getImageData() on the canvas's context
-   Calling toBlob(), toDataURL() or captureStream() on the <canvas>
    element itself

Attempting any of these when the canvas is tainted will cause a
SecurityError to be thrown. This protects users from having private data
exposed by using images to pull information from remote websites without
permission.

Storing an image from a foreign origin

In this example, we wish to permit images from a foreign origin to be
retrieved and saved to local storage. Implementing this requires
configuring the server as well as writing code for the website itself.

Web server configuration

The first thing we need is a server that's configured to host images
with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header configured to permit
cross-origin access to image files.

Let's assume we're serving our site using Apache. Consider the HTML5
Boilerplate Apache server configuration file for CORS images, shown
below:

xml

    <IfModule mod_setenvif.c>
      <IfModule mod_headers.c>
        <FilesMatch "\.(avifs?|bmp|cur|gif|ico|jpe?g|jxl|a?png|svgz?|webp)$">
          SetEnvIf Origin ":" IS_CORS
          Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" env=IS_CORS
        </FilesMatch>
      </IfModule>
    </IfModule>

In short, this configures the server to allow graphic files (those with
the extensions ".bmp", ".cur", ".gif", ".ico", ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png",
".svg", ".svgz", and ".webp") to be accessed cross-origin from anywhere
on the internet.

Implementing the save feature

Now that the server has been configured to allow retrieval of the images
cross-origin, we can write the code that allows the user to save them to
local storage, just as if they were being served from the same domain
the code is running on.

The key is to use the crossorigin attribute by setting crossOrigin on
the HTMLImageElement into which the image will be loaded. This tells the
browser to request cross-origin access when downloading the image data.

Starting the download

The code that starts the download (say, when the user clicks a
"Download" button), looks like this:

js

    function startDownload() {
      let imageURL =
        "https://cdn.glitch.com/4c9ebeb9-8b9a-4adc-ad0a-238d9ae00bb5%2Fmdn_logo-only_color.svg?1535749917189";
      let imageDescription = "The Mozilla logo";

      downloadedImg = new Image();
      downloadedImg.crossOrigin = "anonymous";
      downloadedImg.addEventListener("load", imageReceived, false);
      downloadedImg.alt = imageDescription;
      downloadedImg.src = imageURL;
    }

We're using a hard-coded URL (imageURL) and associated descriptive text
(imageDescription) here, but that could easily come from anywhere. To
begin downloading the image, we create a new HTMLImageElement object by
using the Image() constructor. The image is then configured to allow
cross-origin downloading by setting its crossOrigin attribute to
"anonymous" (that is, allow non-authenticated downloading of the image
cross-origin). An event listener is added for the load event being fired
on the image element, which means the image data has been received.
Alternative text is added to the image; while <canvas> does not support
the alt attribute, the value can be used to set an aria-label or the
canvas's inner content.

Finally, the image's src attribute is set to the URL of the image to
download; this triggers the download to begin.

Receiving and saving the image

The code that handles the newly-downloaded image is found in the
imageReceived() method:

js

    function imageReceived() {
      const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
      const context = canvas.getContext("2d");

      canvas.width = downloadedImg.width;
      canvas.height = downloadedImg.height;
      canvas.innerText = downloadedImg.alt;

      context.drawImage(downloadedImg, 0, 0);
      imageBox.appendChild(canvas);

      try {
        localStorage.setItem("saved-image-example", canvas.toDataURL("image/png"));
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
      }
    }

imageReceived() is called to handle the "load" event on the
HTMLImageElement that receives the downloaded image. This event is
triggered once the downloaded data is all available. It begins by
creating a new <canvas> element that we'll use to convert the image into
a data URL, and by getting access to the canvas's 2D drawing context
(CanvasRenderingContext2D) in the variable context.

The canvas's size is adjusted to match the received image, the inner
text is set to the image description, then the image is drawn into the
canvas using drawImage(). The canvas is then inserted into the document
so the image is visible.

Now it's time to actually save the image locally. To do this, we use the
Web Storage API's local storage mechanism, which is accessed through the
localStorage global. The canvas method toDataURL() is used to convert
the image into a data:// URL representing a PNG image, which is then
saved into local storage using setItem().

# Date and time formats used in HTML#

Certain HTML elements use date and/or time values. The formats of the
strings that specify these values are described in this article.

Elements that use such formats include certain forms of the <input>
element that let the user choose or specify a date, time, or both, as
well as the <ins> and <del> elements, whose datetime attribute specifies
the date or date and time at which the insertion or deletion of content
occurred.

For <input>, the values of type that return a value which contains a
string representing a date and/or time are:

-   date
-   datetime-local
-   month
-   time
-   week

Examples

Before getting into the intricacies of how date and time strings are
written and parsed in HTML, here are some examples that should give you
a good idea what the more commonly-used date and time string formats
look like.

  : Example HTML date and time strings

Basics

Before looking at the various formats of date and time related strings
used by HTML elements, it is helpful to understand a few fundamental
facts about the way they're defined. HTML uses a variation of the ISO
8601 standard for its date and time strings. It's worth reviewing the
descriptions of the formats you're using in order to ensure that your
strings are in fact compatible with HTML, as the HTML specification
includes algorithms for parsing these strings that is actually more
precise than ISO 8601, so there can be subtle differences in how date
and time strings are expected to look.

Character set

Dates and times in HTML are always strings which use the ASCII character
set.

Year numbers

In order to simplify the basic format used for date strings in HTML, the
specification requires that all years be given using the modern (or
proleptic) Gregorian calendar. While user interfaces may allow entry of
dates using other calendars, the underlying value always uses the
Gregorian calendar.

While the Gregorian calendar wasn't created until the year 1582
(replacing the similar Julian calendar), for HTML's purposes, the
Gregorian calendar is extended back to the year 1 C.E. Make sure any
older dates account for this.

For the purposes of HTML dates, years are always at least four digits
long; years prior to the year 1000 are padded with leading zeroes ("0"),
so the year 72 is written as 0072. Years prior to the year 1 C.E. are
not supported, so HTML doesn't support years 1 B.C.E. (1 B.C.) or
earlier.

A year is normally 365 days long, except during leap years.

Leap years

A leap year is any year which is divisible by 400 or the year is
divisible by 4 but not by 100. Although the calendar year is normally
365 days long, it actually takes the planet Earth approximately 365.2422
days to complete a single orbit around the sun. Leap years help to
adjust the calendar to keep it synchronized with the actual position of
the planet in its orbit. Adding a day to the year every four years
essentially makes the average year 365.25 days long, which is close to
correct.

The adjustments to the algorithm (taking a leap year when the year can
be divided by 400, and skipping leap years when the year is divisible by
100) help to bring the average even closer to the correct number of days
(365.2425 days). Scientists occasionally add leap seconds to the
calendar (seriously) to handle the remaining three ten-thousandths of a
day and to compensate for the gradual, naturally occurring slowing of
Earth's rotation.

While month 02, February, normally has 28 days, it has 29 days in leap
years.

Months of the year

There are 12 months in the year, numbered 1 through 12. They are always
represented by a two-digit ASCII string whose value ranges from 01
through 12. See the table in the section Days of the month for the month
numbers and their corresponding names (and lengths in days).

Days of the month

Month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are 31 days long. Months 4, 6,
9, and 11 are 30 days long. Month 2, February, is 28 days long most
years, but is 29 days long in leap years. This is detailed in the
following table.

  Month number   Name (English)   Length in days
  -------------- ---------------- -----------------------
  01             January          31
  02             February         28 (29 in leap years)
  03             March            31
  04             April            30

Week strings

A week string specifies a week within a particular year. A valid week
string consists of a valid year number, followed by a hyphen character
("-", or U+002D), then the capital letter "W" (U+0057), followed by a
two-digit week of the year value.

The week of the year is a two-digit string between 01 and 53. Each week
begins on Monday and ends on Sunday. That means it's possible for the
first few days of January to be considered part of the previous
week-year, and for the last few days of December to be considered part
of the following week-year. The first week of the year is the week that
contains the first Thursday of the year. For example, the first Thursday
of 1953 was on January 1, so that week—beginning on Monday, December
29—is considered the first week of the year. Therefore, December 30,
1952 occurs during the week 1953-W01.

A year has 53 weeks if:

-   The first day of the calendar year (January 1) is a Thursday or
-   The first day of the year (January 1) is a Wednesday and the year is
    a leap year

All other years have 52 weeks.

  Week string   Week and year (Date range)
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  2001-W37      Week 37, 2001 (September 10-16, 2001)
  1953-W01      Week 1, 1953 (December 29, 1952-January 4, 1953)
  1948-W53      Week 53, 1948 (December 27, 1948-January 2, 1949)
  1949-W01      Week 1, 1949 (January 3-9, 1949)
  0531-W16      Week 16, 531 (April 13-19, 531)
  0042-W04      Week 4, 42 (January 21-27, 42)

Note that both the year and week numbers are padded with leading zeroes,
with the year padded to four digits and the week to two.

Month strings

A month string represents a specific month in time, rather than a
generic month of the year. That is, rather than representing "January,"
an HTML month string represents a month and year paired, like "January
1972."

A valid month string consists of a valid year number (a string of at
least four digits), followed by a hyphen character ("-", or U+002D),
followed by a two-digit numeric month number, where 01 represents
January and 12 represents December.

  Month string   Month and year
  -------------- ------------------
  17310-09       September, 17310
  2019-01        January, 2019
  1993-11        November, 1993
  0571-04        April, 571
  0001-07        July, 1 C.E.

Notice that all years are at least four characters long; years that are
fewer than four digits long are padded with leading zeroes.

Date strings

A valid date string consists of a month string, followed by a hyphen
character ("-", or U+002D), followed by a two-digit day of the month.

  Date string   Full date
  ------------- ------------------
  1993-11-01    November 1, 1993
  1066-10-14    October 14, 1066
  0571-04-22    April 22, 571
  0062-02-05    February 5, 62

Time strings

A time string can specify a time with precision to the minute, second,
or to the millisecond. Specifying only the hour or minute isn't
permitted. A valid time string minimally consists of a two-digit hour
followed by a colon (":", U+003A), then a two-digit minute. The minute
may optionally be followed by another colon and a two-digit number of
seconds. Milliseconds may be specified, optionally, by adding a decimal
point character (".", U+002E) followed by one, two, or three digits.

There are some additional basic rules:

-   The hour is always specified using the 24-hour clock, with 00 being
    midnight and 11 PM being 23. No values outside the range 00 – 23 are
    permitted.
-   The minute must be a two-digit number between 00 and 59. No values
    outside that range are allowed.
-   If the number of seconds is omitted (to specify a time accurate only
    to the minute), no colon should follow the number of minutes.
-   If specified, the integer portion of the number of seconds must be
    between 00 and 59. You cannot specify leap seconds by using values
    like 60 or 61.
-   If the number of seconds is specified and is an integer, it must not
    be followed by a decimal point.
-   If a fraction of a second is included, it may be from one to three
    digits long, indicating the number of milliseconds. It follows the
    decimal point placed after the seconds component of the time string.

Local date and time strings

A valid datetime-local string consists of a date string and a time
string concatenated together with either the letter "T" or a space
character separating them. No information about the time zone is
included in the string; the date and time is presumed to be in the
user's local time zone.

When you set the value of a datetime-local input, the string is
normalized into a standard form. Normalized datetime strings always use
the letter "T" to separate the date and the time, and the time portion
of the string is as short as possible. This is done by leaving out the
seconds component if its value is :00.

Global date and time strings

A global date and time string specifies a date and time as well as the
time zone in which it occurs. A valid global date and time string is the
same format as a local date and time string, except it has a time zone
string appended to the end, following the time.

Time zone offset string

A time zone offset string specifies the offset in either a positive or a
negative number of hours and minutes from the standard time base. There
are two standard time bases, which are very close to the same, but not
exactly the same:

-   For dates after the establishment of Coordinated Universal Time
    (UTC) in the early 1960s, the time base is Z and the offset
    indicates a particular time zone's offset from the time at the prime
    meridian at 0º longitude (which passes through the Royal Observatory
    at Greenwich, England).
-   For dates prior to UTC, the time base is instead expressed in terms
    of UT1, which is the contemporary Earth solar time at the prime
    meridian.

The time zone string is appended immediately following the time in the
date and time string. You can specify "Z" as the time zone offset string
to indicate that the time is specified in UTC. Otherwise, the time zone
string is constructed as follows:

1.  A character indicating the sign of the offset: the plus character
    ("+", or U+002B) for time zones to the east of the prime meridian or
    the minus character ("-", or U+002D) for time zones to the west of
    the prime meridian.
2.  A two-digit number of hours that the time zone is offset from the
    prime meridian. This value must be between 00 and 23.
3.  An optional colon (":") character.
4.  A two-digit number of minutes past the hour; this value must be
    between 00 and 59.

While this format allows for time zones between -23:59 and +23:59, the
current range of time zone offsets is -12:00 to +14:00, and no time
zones are currently offset from the hour by anything other than 00, 30,
or 45 minutes. This may change at more or less anytime, since countries
are free to tamper with their time zones at any time and in any way they
wish to do so.

Date issues

Because of data storage and precision issues, you may want to be aware
of a few client-side and server-side issues.

The Y2K38 Problem (often server-side)

JavaScript uses double precision floating points to store dates, as with
all numbers, meaning that JavaScript code will not suffer from the Y2K38
problem unless integer coercion/bit-hacks are used because all
JavaScript bit operators use 32-bit signed 2s-complement integers.

The problem is with the server side of things: storage of dates greater
than 2^31 - 1. To fix this problem, you must store all dates using
either unsigned 32-bit integers, signed 64-bit integers, or
double-precision floating points on the server. If your server is
written in PHP, the fix may be as simple as upgrading to PHP 8 or 7, and
upgrading your hardware to x86_64 or IA64. If you are stuck with other
hardware, you can try to emulate 64-bit hardware inside a 32-bit virtual
machine, but most VMs don't support this kind of virtualization, since
stability may suffer, and performance will definitely suffer greatly.

The Y10k Problem (often client-side)

In many servers, dates are stored as numbers instead of as
strings--numbers of a fixed size and agnostic of format (aside from
endianness). After the year 10,000, those numbers will just be a bit
bigger than before, so many servers will not see issues with forms
submitted after the year 10,000.

The problem is with the client side of things: parsing of dates with
more than 4 digits in the year.

html

    <!--midnight of January 1st, 10000: the exact time of Y10K-->
    <input type="datetime-local" value="+010000-01-01T05:00" />

It's that simple. Just prepare your code for any number of digits. Do
not only prepare for 5 digits. Here is JavaScript code for
programmatically setting the value:

js

    function setValue(element, date) {
      const isoString = date.toISOString();
      element.value = isoString.substring(0, isoString.indexOf("T") + 6);
    }

Why worry about the Y10K problem if it is going to happen many centuries
after your death? Exactly because you will already be dead, so the
companies using your software will be stuck using your software without
any other coder who knows the system well enough to come in and fix it.

# <abbr>: The Abbreviation element#

The <abbr> HTML element represents an abbreviation or acronym.

When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of
the term in plain text on first use, along with the <abbr> to mark up
the abbreviation. This informs the user what the abbreviation or acronym
means.

The optional title attribute can provide an expansion for the
abbreviation or acronym when a full expansion is not present. This
provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content
while informing all users what the abbreviation means. If present, title
must contain this full description and nothing else.

Attributes

This element only supports the global attributes. The title attribute
has a specific semantic meaning when used with the <abbr> element; it
must contain a full human-readable description or expansion of the
abbreviation. This text is often presented by browsers as a tooltip when
the mouse cursor is hovered over the element.

Each <abbr> element you use is independent of all others; providing a
title for one does not automatically attach the same expansion text to
others with the same content text.

Usage notes

Typical use cases

It's certainly not required that all abbreviations be marked up using
<abbr>. There are, though, a few cases where it's helpful to do so:

-   When an abbreviation is used and you want to provide an expansion or
    definition outside the flow of the document's content, use <abbr>
    with an appropriate title.
-   To define an abbreviation which may be unfamiliar to the reader,
    present the term using <abbr> and inline text providing the
    definition. Include a title attribute only when the inline expansion
    or definition is not available.
-   When an abbreviation's presence in the text needs to be semantically
    noted, the <abbr> element is useful. This can be used, in turn, for
    styling or scripting purposes.
-   You can use <abbr> in concert with <dfn> to establish definitions
    for terms which are abbreviations or acronyms. See the example
    Defining an abbreviation below.

Grammar considerations

In languages with grammatical number (that is, languages where the
number of items affects the grammar of a sentence), use the same
grammatical number in your title attribute as inside your <abbr>
element. This is especially important in languages with more than two
numbers, such as Arabic, but is also relevant in English.

Default styling

The purpose of this element is purely for the convenience of the author
and all browsers display it inline (display: inline) by default, though
its default styling varies from one browser to another:

Some browsers add a dotted underline to the content of the element.
Others add a dotted underline while converting the contents to small
caps. Others may not style it differently than a <span> element. To
control this styling, use text-decoration and font-variant.

Examples

Marking up an abbreviation semantically

To mark up an abbreviation without providing an expansion or
description, use <abbr> without any attributes, as seen in this example.

Providing an expansion

the abbreviation or acronym.

HTML

html

    <p>Ashok's joke made me <abbr title="Laugh Out Loud">LOL</abbr> big time.</p>

Defining an abbreviation

You can use <abbr> in tandem with <dfn> to more formally define an
abbreviation, as shown here.

HTML

html

    <p>
      <dfn id="html"><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> </dfn> is a
      markup language used to create the semantics and structure of a web page.

      outlines in detail how a technology or API is intended to function and how it
      is accessed.
    </p>

Result

Accessibility concerns

Spelling out the acronym or abbreviation in full the first time it is
used on a page is beneficial for helping people understand it,
especially if the content is technical or industry jargon.

Only include a title if expanding the abbreviation or acronym in the
text is not possible. Having a difference between the announced word or
phrase and what is displayed on the screen, especially if it's technical
jargon the reader may not be familiar with, can be jarring.

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <acronym> HTML element allows authors to clearly indicate a sequence
of characters that compose an acronym or abbreviation for a word.

Warning: Don't use this element. Use the <abbr> element instead.

Attributes

This element only has global attributes, which are common to all
elements.

DOM Interface

This element implements the HTMLElement interface.

Default styling

Though the purpose of this tag is purely for the convenience of the
author, its default styling varies from one browser to another:

-   Opera, Firefox, Chrome, and some others add a dotted underline to
    the content of the element.
-   A few browsers not only add a dotted underline, but also put it in
    small caps; to avoid this styling, adding something like
    font-variant: none in the CSS takes care of this case.

It is therefore recommended that web authors either explicitly style
this element, or accept some cross-browser variation.

The contact information provided by an <address> element's contents can
take whatever form is appropriate for the context, and may include any
type of contact information that is needed, such as a physical address,
URL, email address, phone number, social media handle, geographic
coordinates, and so forth. The <address> element should include the name
of the person, people, or organization to which the contact information
refers.

<address> can be used in a variety of contexts, such as providing a
business's contact information in the page header, or indicating the
author of an article by including an <address> element within the
<article>.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

-   The <address> element can only be used to represent the contact
    information for its nearest <article> or <body> element ancestor.
-   This element should not contain more information than the contact
    information, like a publication date (which belongs in a <time>
    element).
-   Typically an <address> element can be placed inside the <footer>
    element of the current section, if any.

Examples

This example demonstrates the use of <address> to demarcate the contact
information for an article's author.

html

    <address>
      You can contact author at
      <a href="http://www.example.com/contact">www.example.com</a>.<br />

Result

Although it renders text with the same default styling as the <i> or
<em> elements, it is more appropriate to use <address> when dealing with
contact information, as it conveys additional semantic information.

# <a>: The Anchor element#

The <a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute,
creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in
the same page, or anything else a URL can address.

Content within each <a> should indicate the link's destination. If the
href attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the
<a> element will activate it.

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

download

    Causes the browser to treat the linked URL as a download. Can be
    used with or without a filename value:

    -   Without a value, the browser will suggest a filename/extension,
        generated from various sources:
        -   The Content-Disposition HTTP header
        -   The final segment in the URL path
        -   The media type (from the Content-Type header, the start of a
            data: URL, or Blob.type for a blob: URL)
    -   filename: defining a value suggests it as the filename. / and \
        characters are converted to underscores (_). Filesystems may
        forbid other characters in filenames, so browsers will adjust
        the suggested name if necessary.

    Note:

    -   download only works for same-origin URLs, or the blob: and data:
        schemes.
    -   How browsers treat downloads varies by browser, user settings,
        and other factors. The user may be prompted before a download
        starts, or the file may be saved automatically, or it may open
        automatically, either in an external application or in the
        browser itself.
    -   If the Content-Disposition header has different information from
        the download attribute, resulting behavior may differ:
        -   If the header specifies a filename, it takes priority over a
            filename specified in the download attribute.
        -   If the header specifies a disposition of inline, Chrome and
            Firefox prioritize the attribute and treat it as a download.
            Old Firefox versions (before 82) prioritize the header and
            will display the content inline.

href

    The URL that the hyperlink points to. Links are not restricted to
    HTTP-based URLs — they can use any URL scheme supported by browsers:

    -   Sections of a page with document fragments
    -   Specific text portions with text fragments
    -   Pieces of media files with media fragments
    -   Telephone numbers with tel: URLs
    -   Email addresses with mailto: URLs
    -   SMS text messages with sms: URLs
    -   While web browsers may not support other URL schemes, websites
        can with registerProtocolHandler()

hreflang

    Hints at the human language of the linked URL. No built-in
    functionality. Allowed values are the same as the global lang
    attribute.

ping

    A space-separated list of URLs. When the link is followed, the
    browser will send POST requests with the body PING to the URLs.
    Typically for tracking.

referrerpolicy

    How much of the referrer to send when following the link.

    -   no-referrer: The Referer header will not be sent.
    -   no-referrer-when-downgrade: The Referer header will not be sent
        to origins without TLS (HTTPS).
    -   origin: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the
        referring page: its scheme, host, and port.
    -   origin-when-cross-origin: The referrer sent to other origins
        will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port.
        Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
    -   same-origin: A referrer will be sent for same origin, but
        cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
    -   strict-origin: Only send the origin of the document as the
        referrer when the protocol security level stays the same
        (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination
        (HTTPS→HTTP).
    -   strict-origin-when-cross-origin (default): Send a full URL when
        performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the
        protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send
        no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
    -   unsafe-url: The referrer will include the origin and the path
        (but not the fragment, password, or username). This value is
        unsafe, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected
        resources to insecure origins.

rel

    The relationship of the linked URL as space-separated link types.

target

    Where to display the linked URL, as the name for a browsing context
    (a tab, window, or <iframe>). The following keywords have special
    meanings for where to load the URL:

    -   _self: the current browsing context. (Default)
    -   _blank: usually a new tab, but users can configure browsers to
        open a new window instead.
    -   _parent: the parent browsing context of the current one. If no
        parent, behaves as _self.
    -   _top: the topmost browsing context (the "highest" context that's
        an ancestor of the current one). If no ancestors, behaves as
        _self.

    Note: Setting target="_blank" on <a> elements implicitly provides
    the same rel behavior as setting rel="noopener" which does not set
    window.opener.

type

    Hints at the linked URL's format with a MIME type. No built-in
    functionality.

Deprecated attributes

charset Deprecated

    Hinted at the character encoding of the linked URL.

    Note: This attribute is deprecated and should not be used by
    authors. Use the HTTP Content-Type header on the linked URL.

coords Deprecated

    Used with the shape attribute. A comma-separated list of
    coordinates.

name Deprecated

    Was required to define a possible target location in a page. In HTML
    4.01, id and name could both be used on <a>, as long as they had
    identical values.

    Note: Use the global attribute id instead.

rev Deprecated

    Specified a reverse link; the opposite of the rel attribute.
    Deprecated for being very confusing.

shape Deprecated

    The shape of the hyperlink's region in an image map.

    Note: Use the <area> element for image maps instead.

    <p><a href="#Section_further_down">Jump to the heading below</a></p>

    <!-- Heading to link to -->
    <h2 id="Section_further_down">Section further down</h2>

Result

Note: You can use href="#top" or the empty fragment (href="#") to link
to the top of the current page, as defined in the HTML specification.

Linking to an email address

To create links that open in the user's email program to let them send a
new message, use the mailto: scheme:

html

    <a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere</a>

Result

For details about mailto: URLs, such as including a subject or body, see
Email links or RFC 6068.

Linking to telephone numbers

html

    <a href="tel:+49.157.0156">+49 157 0156</a>
    <a href="tel:+1(800)555-0123">(800) 555-0123</a>

Result

tel: link behavior varies with device capabilities:

-   Cellular devices autodial the number.
-   Most operating systems have programs that can make calls, like Skype
    or FaceTime.
-   Websites can make phone calls with registerProtocolHandler, such as
    web.skype.com.
-   Other behaviors include saving the number to contacts, or sending
    the number to another device.

See RFC 3966 for syntax, additional features, and other details about
the tel: URL scheme.

Using the download attribute to save a <canvas> as a PNG

To save a <canvas> element's contents as an image, you can create a link
where the href is the canvas data as a data: URL created with JavaScript
and the download attribute provides the file name for the downloaded PNG
file:

HTML

html

    <p>
      Paint by holding down the mouse button and moving it.
      <a href="" download="my_painting.png">Download my painting</a>
    </p>

    <canvas width="300" height="300"></canvas>

CSS

      font-family: sans-serif;

    }
    a {
      display: inline-block;
      background: #69c;
      color: #fff;
      padding: 5px 10px;

JavaScript

js

    const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
    const c = canvas.getContext("2d");
    c.fillStyle = "hotpink";
    let isDrawing;

    function draw(x, y) {
      if (isDrawing) {
        c.beginPath();
        c.arc(x, y, 10, 0, Math.PI * 2);
        c.closePath();
        c.fill();
      }
    }

    canvas.addEventListener("mousemove", (event) =>
      draw(event.offsetX, event.offsetY),
    );
    canvas.addEventListener("mousedown", () => (isDrawing = true));
    canvas.addEventListener("mouseup", () => (isDrawing = false));

    document
      .querySelector("a")
      .addEventListener(
        "click",
        (event) => (event.target.href = canvas.toDataURL()),
      );

Result

Security and privacy

<a> elements can have consequences for users' security and privacy. See
Referer header: privacy and security concerns for information.

Using target="_blank" without rel="noreferrer" and rel="noopener" makes
the website vulnerable to window.opener API exploitation attacks,
although note that, in newer browser versions setting target="_blank"
implicitly provides the same protection as setting rel="noopener". See
browser compatibility for details.

Accessibility concerns

Strong link text

The content inside a link should indicate where the link goes, even out
of context.

Inaccessible, weak link text

A sadly common mistake is to only link the words "click here" or "here":

html

    <p>Learn more about our products <a href="/products">here</a>.</p>

Result

Strong link text

Luckily, this is an easy fix, and it's actually shorter than the
inaccessible version!

html

    <p>Learn more <a href="/products">about our products</a>.</p>

Result

Assistive software has shortcuts to list all links on a page. However,
strong link text benefits all users — the "list all links" shortcut
emulates how sighted users quickly scan pages.

onclick events

Anchor elements are often abused as fake buttons by setting their href
to # or javascript:void(0) to prevent the page from refreshing, then
listening for their click events .

These bogus href values cause unexpected behavior when copying/dragging
links, opening links in a new tab/window, bookmarking, or when
JavaScript is loading, errors, or is disabled. They also convey
incorrect semantics to assistive technologies, like screen readers.

Use a <button> instead. In general, you should only use a hyperlink for
navigation to a real URL.

External links and linking to non-HTML resources

Links that open in a new tab/window via target="_blank", or links that
point to a download file should indicate what will happen when the link
is followed.

People experiencing low vision conditions, navigating with the aid of
screen reading technology, or with cognitive concerns may be confused
when a new tab, window, or application opens unexpectedly. Older
screen-reading software may not even announce the behavior.

Link that opens a new tab/window

html

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikipedia.org">
      Wikipedia (opens in new tab)
    </a>

Result

Link to a non-HTML resource

html

    <a href="2017-annual-report.ppt">2017 Annual Report (PowerPoint)</a>

If an icon is used to signify link behavior, make sure it has an alt
text:

html

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikipedia.org">
      Wikipedia
      <img alt="(opens in new tab)" src="newtab.svg" />
    </a>

    <a href="2017-annual-report.ppt">
      2017 Annual Report
      <img alt="(PowerPoint file)" src="ppt-icon.svg" />
    </a>

-   G201: Giving users advanced warning when opening a new window

Skip links

A skip link is a link placed as early as possible in <body> content that
points to the beginning of the page's main content. Usually, CSS hides a
skip link offscreen until focused.

html

    <body>
      <a href="#content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>

      <header>…</header>

      <!-- The skip link jumps to here -->
      <main id="content"></main>
    </body>

css

    .skip-link {
      position: absolute;
      top: -3em;
      background: #fff;
    }
    .skip-link:focus {
      top: 0;
    }

Result

Skip links let keyboard users bypass content repeated throughout
multiple pages, such as header navigation.

Skip links are especially useful for people who navigate with the aid of
assistive technology such as switch control, voice command, or mouth
sticks/head wands, where the act of moving through repetitive links can
be laborious.

Size and proximity

Size

Interactive elements, like links, should provide an area large enough
that it is easy to activate them. This helps a variety of people,
including those with motor control issues and those using imprecise
inputs such as a touchscreen. A minimum size of 44×44 CSS pixels is
recommended.

Text-only links in prose content are exempt from this requirement, but
it's still a good idea to make sure enough text is hyperlinked to be
easily activated.

-   Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.5: Target Size
-   Target Size and 2.5.5
-   Quick test: Large touch targets

Proximity

Interactive elements, like links, placed in close visual proximity
should have space separating them. Spacing helps people with motor
control issues, who may otherwise accidentally activate the wrong
interactive content.

Spacing may be created using CSS properties like margin.

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

alt

    A text string alternative to display on browsers that do not display
    images. The text should be phrased so that it presents the user with
    the same kind of choice as the image would offer when displayed
    without the alternative text. This attribute is required only if the
    href attribute is used.

coords

    The coords attribute details the coordinates of the shape attribute
    in size, shape, and placement of an <area>. This attribute must not
    be used if shape is set to default.

    -   rect: the value is x1,y1,x2,y2. The value specifies the
        coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corner of the
        rectangle. For example, in
        <area shape="rect" coords="0,0,253,27" href="#" target="_blank" alt="Mozilla">
        the coordinates are 0,0 and 253,27, indicating the top-left and
        bottom-right corners of the rectangle, respectively.
    -   circle: the value is x,y,radius. Value specifies the coordinates
        of the circle center and the radius. For example:
        <area shape="circle" coords="130,136,60" href="#" target="_blank" alt="MDN">
    -   poly: the value is x1,y1,x2,y2,..,xn,yn. Value specifies the
        coordinates of the edges of the polygon. If the first and last
        coordinate pairs are not the same, the browser will add the last
        coordinate pair to close the polygon

    The values are numbers of CSS pixels.

download

    This attribute, if present, indicates that the author intends the
    hyperlink to be used for downloading a resource. See <a> for a full
    description of the download attribute.

href

    The hyperlink target for the area. Its value is a valid URL. This
    attribute may be omitted; if so, the <area> element does not
    represent a hyperlink.

ping

    Contains a space-separated list of URLs to which, when the hyperlink
    is followed, POST requests with the body PING will be sent by the
    browser (in the background). Typically used for tracking.

referrerpolicy

    A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the
    resource:

    -   no-referrer: The Referer header will not be sent.
    -   no-referrer-when-downgrade: The Referer header will not be sent
        to origins without TLS (HTTPS).
    -   origin: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the
        referring page: its scheme, host, and port.
    -   origin-when-cross-origin: The referrer sent to other origins
        will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port.
        Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
    -   same-origin: A referrer will be sent for same origin, but
        cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
    -   strict-origin: Only send the origin of the document as the
        referrer when the protocol security level stays the same
        (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination
        (HTTPS→HTTP).
    -   strict-origin-when-cross-origin (default): Send a full URL when
        performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the
        protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send
        no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
    -   unsafe-url: The referrer will include the origin and the path
        (but not the fragment, password, or username). This value is
        unsafe, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected
        resources to insecure origins.

rel

    For anchors containing the href attribute, this attribute specifies
    the relationship of the target object to the link object. The value
    is a space-separated list of link types. The values and their
    semantics will be registered by some authority that might have
    meaning to the document author. The default relationship, if no
    other is given, is void. Use this attribute only if the href
    attribute is present.

shape

    The shape of the associated hot spot. The specifications for HTML
    defines the values rect, which defines a rectangular region; circle,
    which defines a circular region; poly, which defines a polygon; and
    default, which indicates the entire region beyond any defined
    shapes.

target

    A keyword or author-defined name of the browsing context to display
    the linked resource. The following keywords have special meanings:

    -   _self (default): Show the resource in the current browsing
        context.
    -   _blank: Show the resource in a new, unnamed browsing context.
    -   _parent: Show the resource in the parent browsing context of the
        current one, if the current page is inside a frame. If there is
        no parent, acts the same as _self.
    -   _top: Show the resource in the topmost browsing context (the
        browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one and has
        no parent). If there is no parent, acts the same as _self.

    Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.

    Note: Setting target="_blank" on <area> elements implicitly provides
    the same rel behavior as setting rel="noopener" which does not set
    window.opener. See browser compatibility for support status.

Examples

html

    <map name="primary">
      <area
        shape="circle"
        coords="75,75,75"
        href="left.html"
        alt="Click to go Left" />
      <area
        shape="circle"
        coords="275,75,75"
        href="right.html"
        alt="Click to go Right" />

# <article>: The Article Contents element#

The <article> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a
document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be
independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples
include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry,
a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or
gadget, or any other independent item of content.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

-   Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a
    heading (<h1> - <h6> element) as a child of the <article> element.
-   When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an
    article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a
    blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article>
    representing the blog post.
-   Author information of an <article> element can be provided through
    the <address> element, but it doesn't apply to nested <article>
    elements.
-   The publication date and time of an <article> element can be
    described using the datetime attribute of a <time> element.

# <audio>: The Embed Audio element#

The <audio> HTML element is used to embed sound content in documents. It
may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src
attribute or the <source> element: the browser will choose the most
suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a
MediaStream.

%html-content%

The above example shows simple usage of the <audio> element. In a
similar manner to the <img> element, we include a path to the media we
want to embed inside the src attribute; we can include other attributes
to specify information such as whether we want it to autoplay and loop,
whether we want to show the browser's default audio controls, etc.

The content inside the opening and closing <audio></audio> tags is shown
as a fallback in browsers that don't support the element.

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

autoplay

    A Boolean attribute: if specified, the audio will automatically
    begin playback as soon as it can do so, without waiting for the
    entire audio file to finish downloading.

    Note: Sites that automatically play audio (or videos with an audio
    track) can be an unpleasant experience for users, so should be
    avoided when possible. If you must offer autoplay functionality, you
    should make it opt-in (requiring a user to specifically enable it).
    However, this can be useful when creating media elements whose
    source will be set at a later time, under user control. See our
    autoplay guide for additional information about how to properly use
    autoplay.

controls

    If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to
    allow the user to control audio playback, including volume, seeking,
    and pause/resume playback.

controlslist

    The controlslist attribute, when specified, helps the browser select
    what controls to show for the audio element whenever the browser
    shows its own set of controls (that is, when the controls attribute
    is specified).

    The allowed values are nodownload, nofullscreen and
    noremoteplayback.

crossorigin

    This enumerated attribute indicates whether to use CORS to fetch the
    related audio file. CORS-enabled resources can be reused in the
    <canvas> element without being tainted. The allowed values are:

    anonymous

        Sends a cross-origin request without a credential. In other
        words, it sends the Origin: HTTP header without a cookie, X.509
        certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the
        server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not
        setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: HTTP header), the
        resource will be tainted, and its usage restricted.

    use-credentials

        Sends a cross-origin request with a credential. In other words,
        it sends the Origin: HTTP header with a cookie, a certificate,
        or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not
        give credentials to the origin site (through
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: HTTP header), the resource
        will be tainted and its usage restricted.

    When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request
    (i.e. without sending the Origin: HTTP header), preventing its
    non-tainted use in <canvas> elements. If invalid, it is handled as
    if the enumerated keyword anonymous was used. See CORS settings
    attributes for additional information.

disableremoteplayback

    A Boolean attribute used to disable the capability of remote
    playback in devices that are attached using wired (HDMI, DVI, etc.)
    and wireless technologies (Miracast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay,
    etc.). See this proposed specification for more information.

    In Safari, you can use x-webkit-airplay="deny" as a fallback.

loop

    A Boolean attribute: if specified, the audio player will
    automatically seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the
    audio.

muted

    A Boolean attribute that indicates whether the audio will be
    initially silenced. Its default value is false.

preload

    This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the
    browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user
    experience. It may have one of the following values:

    -   none: Indicates that the audio should not be preloaded.
    -   metadata: Indicates that only audio metadata (e.g. length) is
        fetched.
    -   auto: Indicates that the whole audio file can be downloaded,
        even if the user is not expected to use it.
    -   empty string: A synonym of the auto value.

    The default value is different for each browser. The spec advises it
    to be set to metadata.

    Note:

    -   The autoplay attribute has precedence over preload. If autoplay
        is specified, the browser would obviously need to start
        downloading the audio for playback.
    -   The browser is not forced by the specification to follow the
        value of this attribute; it is a mere hint.

src

    The URL of the audio to embed. This is subject to HTTP access
    controls. This is optional; you may instead use the <source> element
    within the audio block to specify the audio to embed.

Events

  Event name       Fired when
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  audioprocess     The input buffer of a ScriptProcessorNode is ready to be processed.
  canplay          The browser can play the media, but estimates that not enough data has been loaded to play the media up to its end without having to stop for further buffering of content.
  canplaythrough   The browser estimates it can play the media up to its end without stopping for content buffering.
  complete         The rendering of an OfflineAudioContext is terminated.
  durationchange   The duration attribute has been updated.
  emptied          The media has become empty; for example, this event is sent if the media has already been loaded (or partially loaded), and the HTMLMediaElement.load method is called to reload it.
  ended            Playback has stopped because the end of the media was reached.
  loadeddata       The first frame of the media has finished loading.
  loadedmetadata   The metadata has been loaded.
  loadstart        Fired when the browser has started to load the resource.
  pause            Playback has been paused.
  play             Playback has begun.
  playing          Playback is ready to start after having been paused or delayed due to lack of data.
  ratechange       The playback rate has changed.
  seeked           A seek operation completed.
  seeking          A seek operation began.
  stalled          The user agent is trying to fetch media data, but data is unexpectedly not forthcoming.
  suspend          Media data loading has been suspended.
  timeupdate       The time indicated by the currentTime attribute has been updated.
  volumechange     The volume has changed.
  waiting          Playback has stopped because of a temporary lack of data

Usage notes

Browsers don't all support the same file types and audio codecs; you can
provide multiple sources inside nested <source> elements, and the
browser will then use the first one it understands:

html

    <audio controls>
      <source src="myAudio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
      <source src="myAudio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
      <p>
        Download <a href="myAudio.mp3">MP3</a> or
        <a href="myAudio.ogg">OGG</a> audio.
      </p>
    </audio>

We offer a substantive and thorough guide to media file types and the
audio codecs that can be used within them. Also available is a guide to
the codecs supported for video.

Other usage notes:

-   If you don't specify the controls attribute, the audio player won't
    include the browser's default controls. You can, however, create
    your own custom controls using JavaScript and the HTMLMediaElement
    API.
-   To allow precise control over your audio content, HTMLMediaElements
    fire many different events. This also provides a way to monitor the
    audio's fetching process so you can watch for errors or detect when
    enough is available to begin to play or manipulate it.
-   You can also use the Web Audio API to directly generate and
    manipulate audio streams from JavaScript code rather than streaming
    pre-existing audio files.
-   <audio> elements can't have subtitles or captions associated with
    them in the same way that <video> elements can. See WebVTT and Audio
    by Ian Devlin for some useful information and workarounds.
-   To test the fallback content on browsers that support the element,
    you can replace <audio> with a non-existing element like
    <notanaudio>.

A good general source of information on using HTML <audio> is the Video
and audio content beginner's tutorial.

Styling with CSS

The <audio> element has no intrinsic visual output of its own unless the
controls attribute is specified, in which case the browser's default
controls are shown.

The default controls have a display value of inline by default, and it
is often a good idea to set the value to block to improve control over
positioning and layout, unless you want it to sit within a text block or
similar.

You can style the default controls with properties that affect the block
as a single unit, so for example you can give it a border and
border-radius, padding, margin, etc. You can't however style the
individual components inside the audio player (e.g. change the button
size or icons, change the font, etc.), and the controls are different
across the different browsers.

To get a consistent look and feel across browsers, you'll need to create
custom controls; these can be marked up and styled in whatever way you
want, and then JavaScript can be used along with the HTMLMediaElement
API to wire up their functionality.

Video player styling basics provides some useful styling techniques — it
is written in the context of <video>, but much of it is equally
applicable to <audio>.

Detecting addition and removal of tracks

You can detect when tracks are added to and removed from an <audio>
element using the addtrack and removetrack events. However, these events
aren't sent directly to the <audio> element itself. Instead, they're
sent to the track list object within the <audio> element's
HTMLMediaElement that corresponds to the type of track that was added to
the element:

HTMLMediaElement.audioTracks

    An AudioTrackList containing all of the media element's audio
    tracks. You can add a listener for addtrack to this object to be
    alerted when new audio tracks are added to the element.

HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks

    Add an addtrack listener to this VideoTrackList object to be
    informed when video tracks are added to the element.

HTMLMediaElement.textTracks

    Add an addtrack event listener to this TextTrackList to be notified
    when new text tracks are added to the element.

Note: Even though it's an <audio> element, it still has video and text
track lists, and can in fact be used to present video, although the user
interface implications can be odd.

For example, to detect when audio tracks are added to or removed from an
<audio> element, you can use code like this:

js

    const elem = document.querySelector("audio");

    elem.audioTrackList.onaddtrack = (event) => {
      trackEditor.addTrack(event.track);
    };

    elem.audioTrackList.onremovetrack = (event) => {
      trackEditor.removeTrack(event.track);
    };

This code watches for audio tracks to be added to and removed from the
element, and calls a hypothetical function on a track editor to register
and remove the track from the editor's list of available tracks.

You can also use addEventListener() to listen for the addtrack and
removetrack events.

Examples

Basic usage

The following example shows simple usage of the <audio> element to play
an OGG file. It will autoplay due to the autoplay attribute—if the page
has permission to do so—and also includes fallback content.

html

    <!-- Simple audio playback -->
    <audio src="AudioTest.ogg" autoplay>
      <a href="AudioTest.ogg">Download OGG audio</a>.
    </audio>

For details on when autoplay works, how to get permission to use
autoplay, and how and when it's appropriate to use autoplay, see our
autoplay guide.

<audio> element with <source> element

This example specifies which audio track to embed using the src
attribute on a nested <source> element rather than directly on the
<audio> element. It is always useful to include the file's MIME type
inside the type attribute, as the browser is able to instantly tell if
it can play that file, and not waste time on it if not.

html

    <audio controls>
      <source src="foo.wav" type="audio/wav" />
      <a href="foo.wav">Download WAV audio</a>.
    </audio>

<audio> with multiple <source> elements

This example includes multiple <source> elements. The browser tries to
load the first source element (Opus) if it is able to play it; if not it
falls back to the second (Vorbis) and finally back to MP3:

html

    <audio controls>
      <source src="foo.opus" type="audio/ogg; codecs=opus" />
      <source src="foo.ogg" type="audio/ogg; codecs=vorbis" />
      <source src="foo.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
    </audio>

Accessibility concerns

Audio with spoken dialog should provide both captions and transcripts
that accurately describe its content. Captions, which are specified
using WebVTT, allow people who are hearing impaired to understand an
audio recording's content as the recording is being played, while
transcripts allow people who need additional time to be able to review
the recording's content at a pace and format that is comfortable for
them.

If automatic captioning services are used, it is important to review the
generated content to ensure it accurately represents the source audio.

The <audio> element doesn't directly support WebVTT. You will have to
find a library or framework that provides the capability for you, or
write the code to display captions yourself. One option is to play your
audio using a <video> element, which does support WebVTT.

In addition to spoken dialog, subtitles and transcripts should also
identify music and sound effects that communicate important information.
This includes emotion and tone. For example, in the WebVTT below, note
the use of square brackets to provide tone and emotional insight to the
viewer; this can help establish the mood otherwise provided using music,
nonverbal sounds and crucial sound effects, and so forth.

Also it's a good practice to provide some content (such as the direct
download link) as a fallback for viewers who use a browser in which the
<audio> element is not supported:

html

    <audio controls>
      <source src="myAudio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
      <source src="myAudio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />

# <base>: The Document Base URL element#

The <base> HTML element specifies the base URL to use for all relative
URLs in a document. There can be only one <base> element in a document.

A document's used base URL can be accessed by scripts with Node.baseURI.
If the document has no <base> elements, then baseURI defaults to
location.href.

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  Content categories     Metadata content.
  Permitted content      None; it is a void element.
  Tag omission           There must be no closing tag.
  Permitted parents      A <head> that doesn't contain another <base> element.
  Implicit ARIA role     No corresponding role
  Permitted ARIA roles   No role permitted
  DOM interface          HTMLBaseElement
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

Warning: A <base> element must have an href attribute, a target
attribute, or both. If at least one of these attributes are specified,
the <base> element must come before other elements with attribute values
that are URLs, such as a <link>'s href attribute.

href

    The base URL to be used throughout the document for relative URLs.
    Absolute and relative URLs are allowed. data: and javascript: URLs
    are not allowed.

target

    A keyword or author-defined name of the default browsing context to
    show the results of navigation from <a>, <area>, or <form> elements
    without explicit target attributes. The following keywords have
    special meanings:

    -   _self (default): Show the result in the current browsing
        context.
    -   _blank: Show the result in a new, unnamed browsing context.
    -   _parent: Show the result in the parent browsing context of the
        current one, if the current page is inside a frame. If there is
        no parent, acts the same as _self.
    -   _top: Show the result in the topmost browsing context (the
        browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one and has
        no parent). If there is no parent, acts the same as _self.

Usage notes

Multiple <base> elements

If multiple <base> elements are used, only the first href and first
target are obeyed — all others are ignored.

In-page anchors

Links pointing to a fragment in the document — e.g. <a href="#some-id">
— are resolved with the <base>, triggering an HTTP request to the base
URL with the fragment attached.

For example, given <base href="https://example.com/"> and this link:
<a href="#anchor">To anchor</a>. The link points to
https://example.com/#anchor.

Open Graph

Open Graph tags do not acknowledge <base>, and should always have full
absolute URLs. For example:

html

    <meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg" />

Examples

html

    <base href="https://www.example.com/" />
    <base target="_blank" />
    <base target="_top" href="https://example.com/" />

# <bdi>: The Bidirectional Isolate element#

The <bdi> HTML element tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to
treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's
particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and
doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted.

%html-content%

Bidirectional text is text that may contain both sequences of characters
that are arranged left-to-right (LTR) and sequences of characters that
are arranged right-to-left (RTL), such as an Arabic quotation embedded
in an English string. Browsers implement the Unicode Bidirectional
Algorithm to handle this. In this algorithm, characters are given an
implicit directionality: for example, Latin characters are treated as
LTR while Arabic characters are treated as RTL. Some other characters
(such as spaces and some punctuation) are treated as neutral and are
assigned directionality based on that of their surrounding characters.

Usually, the bidirectional algorithm will do the right thing without the
author having to provide any special markup but, occasionally, the
algorithm needs help. That's where <bdi> comes in.

The <bdi> element is used to wrap a span of text and instructs the
bidirectional algorithm to treat this text in isolation from its
surroundings. This works in two ways:

-   The directionality of text embedded in <bdi> does not influence the
    directionality of the surrounding text.
-   The directionality of text embedded in <bdi> is not influenced by
    the directionality of the surrounding text.

For example, consider some text like:

    EMBEDDED-TEXT - 1st place

If EMBEDDED-TEXT is LTR, this works fine. But if EMBEDDED-TEXT is RTL,
then - 1 will be treated as RTL text (because it consists of neutral and
weak characters). The result will be garbled:

    1 - EMBEDDED-TEXTst place

If you know the directionality of EMBEDDED-TEXT in advance, you can fix
this problem by wrapping EMBEDDED-TEXT in a <span> with the dir
attribute set to the known directionality. But if you don't know the
directionality - for example, because EMBEDDED-TEXT is being read from a
database or entered by the user - you should use <bdi> to prevent the
directionality of EMBEDDED-TEXT from affecting its surroundings.

Though the same visual effect can be achieved using the CSS rule
unicode-bidi: isolate on a <span> or another text-formatting element,
HTML authors should not use this approach because it is not semantic and
browsers are allowed to ignore CSS styling.

Embedding the characters in <span dir="auto"> has the same effect as
using <bdi>, but its semantics are less clear.

Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global
attributes, except that the dir attribute behaves differently than
normal: it defaults to auto, meaning its value is never inherited from
the parent element. This means that unless you specify a value of either
rtl or ltr for dir, the user agent will determine the correct
directionality to use based on the contents of the <bdi>.

Examples

No bdi with only LTR

This example lists the winners of a competition using <span> elements
only. When the names only contain LTR text the results look fine:

html

    <ul>
      <li><span class="name">Henrietta Boffin</span> - 1st place</li>
      <li><span class="name">Jerry Cruncher</span> - 2nd place</li>
    </ul>

    body {
      border: 1px solid #3f87a6;
      max-width: calc(100% - 40px - 6px);
      padding: 20px;
      width: calc(100% - 40px - 6px);
      border-width: 1px 1px 1px 5px;
    }

No bdi with RTL text

This example lists the winners of a competition using <span> elements
only, and one of the winners has a name consisting of RTL text. In this
case the "- 1", which consists of characters with neutral or weak
directionality, will adopt the directionality of the RTL text, and the
result will be garbled:

html

    <ul>
      <li><span class="name">اَلأَعْشَى</span> - 1st place</li>
      <li><span class="name">Jerry Cruncher</span> - 2nd place</li>
    </ul>

    body {
      border: 1px solid #3f87a6;
      max-width: calc(100% - 40px - 6px);
      padding: 20px;
      width: calc(100% - 40px - 6px);
      border-width: 1px 1px 1px 5px;
    }

Using bdi with LTR and RTL text

This example lists the winners of a competition using <bdi> elements.
These elements instruct the browser to treat the name in isolation from
its embedding context, so the example output is properly ordered:

html

    <ul>
      <li><bdi class="name">اَلأَعْشَى</bdi> - 1st place</li>
      <li><bdi class="name">Jerry Cruncher</bdi> - 2nd place</li>
    </ul>

    body {
      border: 1px solid #3f87a6;
      max-width: calc(100% - 40px - 6px);
      padding: 20px;

# <b>: The Bring Attention To element#

The <b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the
element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance.
This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still
draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b> for styling
text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you
should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an
element is of special importance, you should use the <strong> element.

Usage notes

-   Use the <b> for cases like keywords in a summary, product names in a
    review, or other spans of text whose typical presentation would be
    boldfaced (but not including any special importance).
-   Do not confuse the <b> element with the <strong>, <em>, or <mark>
    elements. The <strong> element represents text of certain
    importance, <em> puts some emphasis on the text and the <mark>
    element represents text of certain relevance. The <b> element
    doesn't convey such special semantic information; use it only when
    no others fit.
-   Similarly, do not mark titles and headings using the <b> element.
    For this purpose, use the h1 to h6 tags. Further, stylesheets can
    change the default style of these elements, with the result that
    they are not necessarily displayed in bold.
-   It is a good practice to use the class attribute on the <b> element
    in order to convey additional semantic information as needed (for
    example <b class="lead"> for the first sentence in a paragraph).
    This makes it easier to manage multiple use cases of <b> if your
    stylistic needs change, without the need to change all of its uses
    in the HTML.
-   Historically, the <b> element was meant to make text boldface.
    Styling information has been deprecated since HTML4, so the meaning
    of the <b> element has been changed.
-   If there is no semantic purpose to using the <b> element, you should
    use the CSS font-weight property with the value "bold" instead in
    order to make text bold.

Examples

      explains their usage in an <b class="keywords">HTML</b> document.

# <big>: The Bigger Text element#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <big> HTML deprecated element renders the enclosed text at a font
size one level larger than the surrounding text (medium becomes large,
for example). The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font
size.

Warning: This element has been removed from the specification and
shouldn't be used anymore. Use the CSS font-size property to adjust the
font size.

Attributes

This element has no other attributes than the global attributes, common
to all elements.

Examples

Here we see examples showing the use of <big> followed by an example
showing how to accomplish the same results using modern CSS syntax
instead.

Using big

This example uses the obsolete <big> element to increase the size of
some text.

HTML

html

    <p>
      This is the first sentence.
      <big>This whole sentence is in bigger letters.</big>
    </p>

Result

Using CSS font-size

This example uses the CSS font-size property to increase the font size
by one level.

# <blockquote>: The Block Quotation element#

The <blockquote> HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is an
extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation
(see Notes for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation
may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of
the source can be given using the <cite> element.

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

cite

    A URL that designates a source document or message for the
    information quoted. This attribute is intended to point to
    information explaining the context or the reference for the quote.

Usage notes

To change the indentation applied to the quoted text, use the CSS
margin-left and/or margin-right properties, or the margin shorthand
property.

To include shorter quotes inline rather than in a separate block, use
the <q> (Quotation) element.

Examples

This example demonstrates the use of the <blockquote> element to quote a
passage from RFC 1149, A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams
on Avian Carriers.

html

    <blockquote cite="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1149">
      <p>
        Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude
        service. The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path
        for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
        without significant interference with each other, outside early spring. This
        is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast to
        the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers have an intrinsic collision
        avoidance system, which increases availability.

# <br>: The Line Break element#

The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).
It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of
lines is significant.

%html-content%

As you can see from the above example, a <br> element is included at
each point where we want the text to break. The text after the <br>
begins again at the start of the next line of the text block.

Note: Do not use <br> to create margins between paragraphs; wrap them in
<p> elements and use the CSS margin property to control their size.

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

Deprecated attributes

clear Deprecated

    Indicates where to begin the next line after the break.

Styling with CSS

The <br> element has a single, well-defined purpose — to create a line
break in a block of text. As such, it has no dimensions or visual output
of its own, and there is very little you can do to style it.

You can set a margin on <br> elements themselves to increase the spacing
between the lines of text in the block, but this is a bad practice — you
should use the line-height property that was designed for that purpose.

Examples

Simple br

In the following example we use <br> elements to create line breaks
between the different lines of a postal address:

html

    Mozilla<br />
    331 E. Evelyn Avenue<br />
    Mountain View, CA<br />
    94041<br />
    USA<br />

Result

Accessibility concerns

Creating separate paragraphs of text using <br> is not only bad
practice, it is problematic for people who navigate with the aid of
screen reading technology. Screen readers may announce the presence of
the element, but not any content contained within <br>s. This can be a
confusing and frustrating experience for the person using the screen
reader.

Use <p> elements, and use CSS properties like margin to control their
spacing.

# <button>: The Button element#

The <button> HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user
with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive
technology. Once activated, it then performs an action, such as
submitting a form or opening a dialog.

By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the
platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance
with CSS.

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

autofocus

    This Boolean attribute specifies that the button should have input
    focus when the page loads. Only one element in a document can have
    this attribute.

disabled

    This Boolean attribute prevents the user from interacting with the
    button: it cannot be pressed or focused.

    Firefox, unlike other browsers, persists the dynamic disabled state
    of a <button> across page loads. To control this feature, use the
    autocomplete attribute.

form

    The <form> element to associate the button with (its form owner).
    The value of this attribute must be the id of a <form> in the same
    document. (If this attribute is not set, the <button> is associated
    with its ancestor <form> element, if any.)

    This attribute lets you associate <button> elements to <form>s
    anywhere in the document, not just inside a <form>. It can also
    override an ancestor <form> element.

formaction

    The URL that processes the information submitted by the button.
    Overrides the action attribute of the button's form owner. Does
    nothing if there is no form owner.

formenctype

    If the button is a submit button (it's inside/associated with a
    <form> and doesn't have type="button"), specifies how to encode the
    form data that is submitted. Possible values:

    -   application/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default if the attribute
        is not used.
    -   multipart/form-data: Used to submit <input> elements with their
        type attributes set to file.
    -   text/plain: Specified as a debugging aid; shouldn't be used for
        real form submission.

    If this attribute is specified, it overrides the enctype attribute
    of the button's form owner.

formmethod

    If the button is a submit button (it's inside/associated with a
    <form> and doesn't have type="button"), this attribute specifies the
    HTTP method used to submit the form. Possible values:

    -   post: The data from the form are included in the body of the
        HTTP request when sent to the server. Use when the form contains
        information that shouldn't be public, like login credentials.
    -   get: The form data are appended to the form's action URL, with a
        ? as a separator, and the resulting URL is sent to the server.
        Use this method when the form has no side effects, like search
        forms.
    -   dialog: This method is used to indicate that the button closes
        the dialog with which it is associated, and does not transmit
        the form data at all.

    If specified, this attribute overrides the method attribute of the
    button's form owner.

formnovalidate

    If the button is a submit button, this Boolean attribute specifies
    that the form is not to be validated when it is submitted. If this
    attribute is specified, it overrides the novalidate attribute of the
    button's form owner.

    This attribute is also available on <input type="image"> and
    <input type="submit"> elements.

formtarget

    If the button is a submit button, this attribute is an
    author-defined name or standardized, underscore-prefixed keyword
    indicating where to display the response from submitting the form.
    This is the name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (a tab,
    window, or <iframe>). If this attribute is specified, it overrides
    the target attribute of the button's form owner. The following
    keywords have special meanings:

    -   _self: Load the response into the same browsing context as the
        current one. This is the default if the attribute is not
        specified.
    -   _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context —
        usually a new tab or window, depending on the user's browser
        settings.
    -   _parent: Load the response into the parent browsing context of
        the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the
        same way as _self.
    -   _top: Load the response into the top-level browsing context
        (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the
        current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this
        option behaves the same way as _self.

name

    The name of the button, submitted as a pair with the button's value
    as part of the form data, when that button is used to submit the
    form.

popovertarget

    Turns a <button> element into a popover control button; takes the ID
    of the popover element to control as its value. See the Popover API
    landing page for more details.

popovertargetaction

    Specifies the action to be performed on a popover element being
    controlled by a control <button>. Possible values are:

    "hide"

        The button will hide a shown popover. If you try to hide an
        already hidden popover, no action will be taken.

    "show"

        The button will show a hidden popover. If you try to show an
        already showing popover, no action will be taken.

    "toggle"

        The button will toggle a popover between showing and hidden. If
        the popover is hidden, it will be shown; if the popover is
        showing, it will be hidden. If popovertargetaction is omitted,
        "toggle" is the default action that will be performed by the
        control button.

type

    The default behavior of the button. Possible values are:

    -   submit: The button submits the form data to the server. This is
        the default if the attribute is not specified for buttons
        associated with a <form>, or if the attribute is an empty or
        invalid value.
    -   reset: The button resets all the controls to their initial
        values, like <input type="reset">. (This behavior tends to annoy
        users.)
    -   button: The button has no default behavior, and does nothing
        when pressed by default. It can have client-side scripts listen
        to the element's events, which are triggered when the events
        occur.

value

    Defines the value associated with the button's name when it's
    submitted with the form data. This value is passed to the server in
    params when the form is submitted using this button.

Notes

A submit button with the attribute formaction set, but without an
associated form does nothing. You have to set a form owner, either by
wrapping it in a <form> or set the attribute form to the id of the form.

<button> elements are much easier to style than <input> elements. You
can add inner HTML content (think <i>, <br>, or even <img>), and use
::after and ::before pseudo-elements for complex rendering.

If your buttons are not for submitting form data to a server, be sure to
set their type attribute to button. Otherwise they will try to submit
form data and to load the (nonexistent) response, possibly destroying
the current state of the document.

While <button type="button"> has no default behavior, event handlers can
be scripted to trigger behaviors. An activated button can perform
programmable actions using JavaScript, such as removing an item from a
list.

Examples

html

    <button name="button">Press me</button>

Accessibility concerns

Icon buttons

Buttons that only show an icon to represent do not have an accessible
name. Accessible names provide information for assistive technology,
such as screen readers, to access when they parse the document and
generate an accessibility tree. Assistive technology then uses the
accessibility tree to navigate and manipulate page content.

To give an icon button an accessible name, put text in the <button>
element that concisely describes the button's functionality.

Examples

html

    <button name="favorite">
      <svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 10 10">
        <path d="M7 9L5 8 3 9V6L1 4h3l1-3 1 3h3L7 6z" />
      </svg>
      Add to favorites
    </button>

Result

If you want to visually hide the button's text, an accessible way to do
so is to use a combination of CSS properties to remove it visually from
the screen, but keep it parsable by assistive technology.

However, it is worth noting that leaving the button text visually
apparent can aid people who may not be familiar with the icon's meaning
or understand the button's purpose. This is especially relevant for
people who are not technologically sophisticated, or who may have
different cultural interpretations for the icon the button uses.

Size and Proximity

Size

Interactive elements such as buttons should provide an area large enough
that it is easy to activate them. This helps a variety of people,
including people with motor control issues and people using non-precise
forms of input such as a stylus or fingers. A minimum interactive size
of 44×44 CSS pixels is recommended.

-   Quick test: Large touch targets - The A11Y Project

Proximity

Large amounts of interactive content — including buttons — placed in
close visual proximity to each other should have space separating them.
This spacing is beneficial for people who are experiencing motor control
issues, who may accidentally activate the wrong interactive content.

Spacing may be created using CSS properties such as margin.

ARIA state information

To describe the state of a button the correct ARIA attribute to use is
aria-pressed and not aria-checked or aria-selected. To find out more
read the information about the ARIA button role.

Firefox

Firefox will add a small dotted border on a focused button. This border
is declared through CSS in the browser stylesheet, but you can override
it to add your own focused style using button::-moz-focus-inner { }.

If overridden, it is important to ensure that the state change when
focus is moved to the button is high enough that people experiencing low
vision conditions will be able to perceive it.

Color contrast ratio is determined by comparing the luminosity of the
button text and background color values compared to the background the
button is placed on. In order to meet current Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG), a ratio of 4.5:1 is required for text content and 3:1
for large text. (Large text is defined as 18.66px and bold or larger, or
24px or larger.)

-   MDN Understanding WCAG, Guideline 1.4 explanations
-   Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.0

Clicking and focus

Whether clicking on a <button> or <input> button types causes it to (by
default) become focused varies by browser and OS. Most browsers do give
focus to a button being clicked, but Safari does not, by design.

  DOM interface          HTMLCanvasElement
  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

height

    The height of the coordinate space in CSS pixels. Defaults to 150.

moz-opaque Non-standard Deprecated

    Lets the canvas know whether translucency will be a factor. If the
    canvas knows there's no translucency, painting performance can be
    optimized. This is only supported by Mozilla-based browsers; use the
    standardized canvas.getContext('2d', { alpha: false }) instead.

width

    The width of the coordinate space in CSS pixels. Defaults to 300.

Usage notes

Alternative content

You should provide alternate content inside the <canvas> block. That
content will be rendered both on older browsers that don't support
canvas and in browsers with JavaScript disabled.

Closing </canvas> tag

Unlike the <img> element, the <canvas> element requires the closing tag
(</canvas>).

Sizing the canvas using CSS versus HTML

The displayed size of the canvas can be changed using CSS, but if you do
this the image is scaled during rendering to fit the styled size, which
can make the final graphics rendering end up being distorted.

It is better to specify your canvas dimensions by setting the width and
height attributes directly on the <canvas> elements, either directly in
the HTML or by using JavaScript.

Maximum canvas size

The exact maximum size of a <canvas> element depends on the browser and
environment. While in most cases the maximum dimensions exceed 10,000 x
10,000 pixels, notably iOS devices limit the canvas size to only 4,096 x
4,096 pixels. See canvas size limits in different browsers and devices
(2021).

Note: Exceeding the maximum dimensions or area renders the canvas
unusable — drawing commands will not work.

Using an offscreen canvas

A canvas can be rendered using the OffscreenCanvas API where the
document and canvas are decoupled. The benefit is that a worker thread
can handle canvas rendering and the main thread of your web application
is not blocked by canvas operations. By parallelizing work, other UI
elements of your web application will remain responsive even if you are
running complex graphics on an offscreen canvas. For more information,
see the OffscreenCanvas API documentation.

Examples

HTML

This code snippet adds a canvas element to your HTML document. A
fallback text is provided if a browser is unable to read or render the
canvas.

html

    <canvas width="120" height="120">
      An alternative text describing what your canvas displays.
    </canvas>

JavaScript

Then in the JavaScript code, call HTMLCanvasElement.getContext() to get
a drawing context and start drawing onto the canvas:

js

    const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
    const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
    ctx.fillStyle = "green";
    // Add a rectangle at (10, 10) with size 100x100 pixels
    ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);

Result

Accessibility concerns

Alternative content

The <canvas> element on its own is just a bitmap and does not provide
information about any drawn objects. Canvas content is not exposed to
accessibility tools as semantic HTML is. In general, you should avoid
using canvas in an accessible website or app. The following guides can
help to make it more accessible.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

Deprecated attributes

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are
documented below for reference when updating existing code and for
historical interest only.

align Deprecated

    Specifies on which side of the table the caption should be
    displayed. The possible enumerated values are left, top, right, or
    bottom. Use the caption-side and text-align CSS properties instead,
    as this attribute is deprecated.

Usage notes

-   If included, the <caption> element must be the first child of its
    parent <table> element.
-   When a <table> is nested within a <figure> as the figure's only
    content, it should be captioned via a <figcaption> for the <figure>
    instead of as a <caption> nested within the <table>.
-   Any background-color applied to a table will not be applied to its
    caption. Add a background-color to the <caption> element as well if
    you want the same color to be behind both.

Example

See <table> for a complete table example introducing common standards
and best practices.

This example demonstrates a basic table that includes a caption
describing the data presented.

Such a "title" is helpful for users who are quickly scanning the page,
and it is especially beneficial for visually impaired users, allowing
them to determine the table's relevance quickly without the need to have
a screen reader read the contents of many cells just to find out what
the table is about.

HTML

A <caption> element is used as the first child of the <table>, with text
content similar to a title to describe the table data. Three rows, the
first being a header row, with two columns are created using the <tr>,
<th> and <td> elements after the <caption>.

html

    <table>
      <caption>
        User login email addresses
      </caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Login</th>
        <th>Email</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>user1</td>
        <td>user1@example.com</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>user2</td>
        <td>user2@example.com</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

Some basic CSS is used to align and highlight the <caption>.

css

    caption {
      caption-side: top;
      text-align: left;
      padding-bottom: 10px;
      font-weight: bold;
    }

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);

# <center>: The Centered Text element#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <center> HTML element is a block-level element that displays its
block-level or inline contents centered horizontally within its
containing element. The container is usually, but isn't required to be,
<body>.

This tag has been deprecated in HTML 4 (and XHTML 1) in favor of the CSS
text-align property, which can be applied to the <div> element or to an
individual <p>. For centering blocks, use other CSS properties like
margin-left and margin-right and set them to auto (or set margin to
0 auto).

DOM interface

This element implements the HTMLElement interface.

Example 1

html

    <center>
      This text will be centered.
      <p>So will this paragraph.</p>
    </center>

Result

Example 2 (CSS alternative)

html

    <div style="text-align:center">
      This text will be centered.
      <p>So will this paragraph.</p>
    </div>

Result

Example 3 (CSS alternative)

html

    <p style="text-align:center">
      This line will be centered.<br />
      And so will this line.
    </p>

Result

Note: Applying text-align:center to a <div> or <p> element centers the
contents of those elements while leaving their overall dimensions
unchanged.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

span

    Specifies the number of consecutive columns the <colgroup> element
    spans. The value must be a positive integer greater than zero. If
    not present, its default value is 1.

    Note: The span attribute is not permitted if there are one or more
    <col> elements within the <colgroup>.

Deprecated attributes

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are
documented below for reference when updating existing code and for
historical interest only.

align Deprecated

    Specifies the horizontal alignment of each column group cell. The
    possible enumerated values are left, center, right, justify, and
    char. When supported, the char value aligns the textual content on
    the character defined in the char attribute and the offset defined
    by the charoff attribute. Note that the descendant <col> elements
    may override this value using their own align attribute. Use the
    text-align CSS property on the <td> and <th> elements instead, as
    this attribute is deprecated.

    Note: Setting text-align on the <colgroup> element has no effect as
    <td> and <th> elements are not descendants of the <colgroup>
    element, and therefore they do not inherit from it.

    If the table does not use a colspan attribute, use the
    td:nth-of-type(an+b) CSS selector per column, where a is the total
    number of the columns in the table and b is the ordinal position of
    the column in the table, e.g.
    td:nth-of-type(7n+2) { text-align: right; } to right-align the
    second column cells.

    If the table does use a colspan attribute, the effect can be
    achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like
    [colspan=n], though this is not trivial.

bgcolor Deprecated

    Defines the background color of each column group cell. The value is
    an HTML color; either a 6-digit hexadecimal RGB code, prefixed by a
    '#', or a color keyword. Other CSS <color> values are not supported.
    Use the background-color CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

char Deprecated

    Specifies the alignment of the content to a character of each column
    group cell. Typical values for this include a period (.) when
    attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If align is not set
    to char, this attribute is ignored, though it will still be used as
    the default value for the align of the <col> elements which are
    members of this column group.

charoff Deprecated

    Specifies the number of characters to offset the column group cell
    content from the alignment character specified by the char
    attribute.

valign Deprecated

    Specifies the vertical alignment of each column group cell. The
    possible enumerated values are baseline, bottom, middle, and top.
    Note that the descendant <col> elements may override this value
    using their own valign attribute. Use the vertical-align CSS
    property on the <td> and <th> elements instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

    Note: Setting vertical-align on the <colgroup> element has no effect
    as <td> and <th> elements are not descendants of the <colgroup>
    element, and therefore they do not inherit from it.

    If the table does not use a colspan attribute, use the
    td:nth-of-type() CSS selector per column, e.g.
    td:nth-of-type(2) { vertical-align: middle; } to center the second
    column cells vertically.

    If the table does use a colspan attribute, the effect can be
    achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like
    [colspan=n], though this is not trivial.

width Deprecated

    Specifies a default width for each column in the current column
    group. In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values, this
    attribute can take the special form 0*, which means that the width
    of each column spanned should be the minimum width necessary to hold
    the column's contents. Relative widths such as 5* can also be used.
    Note that the descendant <col> elements may override this value
    using their own width attribute. Use the width CSS property instead,
    as this attribute is deprecated.

Usage notes

-   The <colgroup> should appear within a <table>, after any <caption>
    element (if used), but before any <thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, and
    <tr> elements.
-   Only a limited number of CSS properties affect <colgroup>:
    -   background : The various background properties will set the
        background for cells within the column group. As the column
        group background color is painted on top of the table, but
        behind background colors applied to the columns (<col>), the row
        groups (<thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>), the rows (<tr>), and the
        individual cells (<th> and <td>), backgrounds applied to table
        column groups are only visible if every layer painted on top of
        them has a transparent background.
    -   border: The various border properties apply, but only if the
        <table> has border-collapse: collapse set.
    -   visibility: The value collapse for a column group results in all
        cells of the columns in that column group not being rendered,
        and cells spanning into other columns being clipped. The space
        these columns in the column group would have occupied is
        removed. However, the size of other columns is still calculated
        as though the cells in the collapsed column(s) in the column
        group are present. Other values for visibility have no effect.
    -   width: The width property defines a minimum width for the
        columns within the column group, as if min-width were set.

Example

See <table> for a complete table example introducing common standards
and best practices.

This example demonstrates a seven-column table divided into two
<colgroup> elements that span multiple columns.

HTML

Two <colgroup> elements are used to structure a basic table by creating
column groups. The number of columns in each column group is specified
by the span attribute.

html

    <table>
      <caption>
        Personal weekly activities
      </caption>
      <colgroup span="5" class="weekdays"></colgroup>
      <colgroup span="2" class="weekend"></colgroup>
      <tr>
        <th>Mon</th>
        <th>Tue</th>
        <th>Wed</th>
        <th>Thu</th>
        <th>Fri</th>
        <th>Sat</th>
        <th>Sun</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Clean room</td>
        <td>Football training</td>
        <td>Dance Course</td>
        <td>History Class</td>
        <td>Buy drinks</td>
        <td>Study hour</td>
        <td>Free time</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Yoga</td>
        <td>Chess Club</td>
        <td>Meet friends</td>
        <td>Gymnastics</td>
        <td>Birthday party</td>
        <td>Fishing trip</td>
        <td>Free time</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

Grouped columns can be used to visually highlight the structure using
CSS:

css

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
    }

    caption {
      caption-side: bottom;
      padding: 10px;
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 8px 6px;
      text-align: center;
    }

    .weekdays {
      background-color: #d7d9f2;
    }

    .weekend {
      background-color: #ffe8d4;
    }

Attributes

span

    Specifies the number of consecutive columns the <col> element spans.
    The value must be a positive integer greater than zero. If not
    present, its default value is 1.

Deprecated attributes

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are
documented below for reference when updating existing code and for
historical interest only.

align Deprecated

    Specifies the horizontal alignment of each column cell. The possible
    enumerated values are left, center, right, justify, and char. When
    supported, the char value aligns the textual content on the
    character defined in the char attribute and on offset defined by the
    charoff attribute. Note that this attribute overrides the specified
    align of its <colgroup> parent element. Use the text-align CSS
    property on the <td> and <th> elements instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

    Note: Setting text-align on the <col> element has no effect as <col>
    has no descendants, and therefore no elements inherit from it.

    If the table does not use a colspan attribute, use the
    td:nth-of-type(an+b) CSS selector. Set a to zero and b to the
    position of the column in the table, e.g.
    td:nth-of-type(2) { text-align: right; } to right-align the second
    column cells.

    If the table does use a colspan attribute, the effect can be
    achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like
    [colspan=n], though this is not trivial.

bgcolor Deprecated

    Defines the background color of each column cell. The value is an
    HTML color; either a 6-digit hexadecimal RGB code, prefixed by a
    '#', or a color keyword. Other CSS <color> values are not supported.
    Use the background-color CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

char Deprecated

    Specifies the alignment of the content to a character of each column
    cell. Typical values for this include a period (.) when attempting
    to align numbers or monetary values. If align is not set to char,
    this attribute is ignored, though it will still override the
    specified char of its <colgroup> parent element.

charoff Deprecated

    Specifies the number of characters to offset the column cell content
    from the alignment character specified by the char attribute.

valign Deprecated

    Specifies the vertical alignment of each column cell. The possible
    enumerated values are baseline, bottom, middle, and top. Note that
    this attribute overrides the specified valign of its <colgroup>
    parent element. Use the vertical-align CSS property on the <td> and
    <th> elements instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

    Note: Setting vertical-align on the <col> element has no effect as
    <col> has no descendants, and therefore no elements inherit from it.

    If the table does not use a colspan attribute, use the
    td:nth-of-type(an+b) CSS selector. Set a to zero and b to the
    position of the column in the table, e.g.
    td:nth-of-type(2) { vertical-align: middle; } to center the second
    column cells vertically.

    If the table does use a colspan attribute, the effect can be
    achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like
    [colspan=n], though this is not trivial.

width Deprecated

    Specifies a default width for each column. In addition to the
    standard pixel and percentage values, this attribute can take the
    special form 0*, which means that the width of each column spanned
    should be the minimum width necessary to hold the column's contents.
    Relative widths such as 5* can also be used. Note that this
    attribute overrides the specified width of its <colgroup> parent
    element. Use the width CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

Usage notes

-   The <col> element is used within a <colgroup> element that doesn't
    have a span attribute.
-   The <col> elements do not structurally group columns together. This
    is the role of the <colgroup> element.
-   Only a limited number of CSS properties affect <col>:
    -   background : The various background properties will set the
        background for cells within the column. As the column background
        color is painted on top of the table and column groups
        (<colgroup>), but behind background colors applied to the row
        groups (<thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>), the rows (<tr>), and the
        individual cells (<th> and <td>), backgrounds applied to table
        columns are only visible if every layer painted on top of them
        has a transparent background.
    -   border: The various border properties apply, but only if the
        <table> has border-collapse: collapse set.
    -   visibility: The value collapse for a column results in all cells
        of that column not being rendered, and cells spanning into other
        columns being clipped. The space these columns would have
        occupied is removed. However, the size of other columns is still
        calculated as though the cells in the collapsed column(s) are
        present. Other values for visibility have no effect.
    -   width: The width property defines a minimum width for the
        column, as if min-width were set.

Example

See <table> for a complete table example introducing common standards
and best practices.

This example demonstrates an eight-column table divided into three <col>
elements.

HTML

A <colgroup> element provides structures to a basic table, creating a
single implicit column group. Three <col> elements are included within
the <colgroup>, creating three stylable columns. The span attribute
specifies the number of table columns each <col> should span (defaulting
to 1 when omitted), enabling attributes to be shared across the columns
in each <col>.

html

    <table>
      <caption>
        Personal weekly activities
      </caption>
      <colgroup>
        <col />
        <col span="5" class="weekdays" />
        <col span="2" class="weekend" />
      </colgroup>
      <tr>
        <th>Period</th>
        <th>Mon</th>
        <th>Tue</th>

        <td>Birthday party</td>
        <td>Fishing trip</td>
        <td>Free time</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

We use CSS, instead of deprecated HTML attributes, to provide a
background color to the columns and align the cell content:

css

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
    }

    caption {
      caption-side: bottom;
      padding: 10px;
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 8px 6px;
      text-align: center;
    }

    .weekdays {
      background-color: #d7d9f2;
    }

    .weekend {
      background-color: #ffe8d4;
    }

# <datalist>: The HTML Data List element#

The <datalist> HTML element contains a set of <option> elements that
represent the permissible or recommended options available to choose
from within other controls.

%html-content%

To bind the <datalist> element to the control, we give it a unique
identifier in the id attribute, and then add the list attribute to the
<input> element with the same identifier as value. Only certain types of
<input> support this behavior, and it can also vary from browser to
browser.

Note: The <option> element can store a value as internal content and in
the value and label attributes. Which one will be visible in the
drop-down menu depends on the browser, but when clicked, content entered
into control field will always come from the value attribute.

Attributes

This element has no other attributes than the global attributes, common
to all elements.

Examples

Textual types

Recommended values in types text, search, url, tel, email and number,
are displayed in a drop-down menu when user clicks or double-clicks on
the control. Typically the right side of a control will also have an
arrow pointing to the presence of predefined values.

html

    <label for="myBrowser">Choose a browser from this list:</label>
    <input list="browsers" id="myBrowser" name="myBrowser" />
    <datalist id="browsers">
      <option value="Chrome"></option>
      <option value="Firefox"></option>
      <option value="Opera"></option>
      <option value="Safari"></option>
      <option value="Microsoft Edge"></option>
    </datalist>

Date and Time types

The types month, week, date, time and datetime-local can show an
interface that allows a convenient selection of a date and time.
Predefined values can be shown there, allowing the user to quickly fill
the control value.

Note: When type is not supported, text type creating simple text field
will be used instead. That field will correctly recognize recommended
values and display them to the user in a drop-down menu.

html

    <input type="time" list="popularHours" />
    <datalist id="popularHours">
      <option value="12:00"></option>
      <option value="13:00"></option>
      <option value="14:00"></option>
    </datalist>

Range type

The recommended values in the range type will be shown as series of hash
marks that the user can easily select.

html

    <label for="tick">Tip amount:</label>
    <input type="range" list="tickmarks" min="0" max="100" id="tick" name="tick" />
    <datalist id="tickmarks">
      <option value="0"></option>
      <option value="10"></option>
      <option value="20"></option>
      <option value="30"></option>
    </datalist>

Color type

The color type can show predefined colors in a browser-provided
interface.

html

    <label for="colors">Pick a color (preferably a red tone):</label>
    <input type="color" list="redColors" id="colors" />
    <datalist id="redColors">
      <option value="#800000"></option>
      <option value="#8B0000"></option>
      <option value="#A52A2A"></option>
      <option value="#DC143C"></option>
    </datalist>

Password type

The specification allows linking <datalist> with a password type, but no
browser supports it for security reasons.

html

    <label for="pwd">Enter a password:</label>
    <input type="password" list="randomPassword" id="pwd" />
    <datalist id="randomPassword">
      <option value="5Mg[_3DnkgSu@!q#"></option>
    </datalist>

  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------

Accessibility concerns

When deciding to use the <datalist> element, here are some accessibility
issues to be mindful of:

-   The font size of the data list's options does not zoom, always
    remaining the same size. The contents of the autosuggest do not grow
    or shrink when the rest of the contents are zoomed in or out.
-   As targeting the list of options with CSS is very limited to
    non-existent, rendering can not be styled for high-contrast mode.
-   Some screen reader/browser combinations, including NVDA and Firefox,
    do not announce the contents of the autosuggest popup.

The <del> HTML element represents a range of text that has been deleted
from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or
source code diff information, for example. The <ins> element can be used
for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the
document.

    parsed as a date with an optional time string, the element does not
    have an associated timestamp. For the format of the string without a

    date and time is covered in Local date and time strings.

Accessibility concerns

The presence of the del element is not announced by most screen reading
technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be announced
by using the CSS content property, along with the ::before and ::after
pseudo-elements.

css

    del::before,
    del::after {
      clip-path: inset(100%);
      clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
      height: 1px;
      overflow: hidden;
      position: absolute;
      white-space: nowrap;
      width: 1px;
    }

    del::before {
      content: " [deletion start] ";
    }

    del::after {
      content: " [deletion end] ";
    }

Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing
content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important
to not abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not
knowing content has been deleted would adversely affect understanding.

# <details>: The Details disclosure element#

The <details> HTML element creates a disclosure widget in which
information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open"
state. A summary or label must be provided using the <summary> element.

A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small
triangle that rotates (or twists) to indicate open/closed status, with a
label next to the triangle. The contents of the <summary> element are
used as the label for the disclosure widget. The contents of the
<details> provide the accessible description for the <summary>.

      margin-bottom: 0.5em;
    }

Output

Console Output

%html-content%

A <details> widget can be in one of two states. The default closed state
displays only the triangle and the label inside <summary> (or a user
agent-defined default string if no <summary>).

When the user clicks on the widget or focuses it then presses the space
bar, it "twists" open, revealing its contents. The common use of a
triangle which rotates or twists around to represent opening or closing
the widget is why these are sometimes called "twisty".

You can use CSS to style the disclosure widget, and you can
programmatically open and close the widget by setting/removing its open
attribute. Unfortunately, at this time, there's no built-in way to
animate the transition between open and closed.

By default when closed, the widget is only tall enough to display the
disclosure triangle and summary. When open, it expands to display the
details contained within.

Fully standards-compliant implementations automatically apply the CSS
display: list-item to the <summary> element. You can use this to
customize its appearance further. See Customizing the disclosure widget
for further details.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

open

    This Boolean attribute indicates whether the details — that is, the
    contents of the <details> element — are currently visible. The
    details are shown when this attribute exists, or hidden when this
    attribute is absent. By default this attribute is absent which means
    the details are not visible.

    Note: You have to remove this attribute entirely to make the details
    hidden. open="false" makes the details visible because this
    attribute is Boolean.

Events

In addition to the usual events supported by HTML elements, the
<details> element supports the toggle event, which is dispatched to the
<details> element whenever its state changes between open and closed. It
is sent after the state is changed, although if the state changes
multiple times before the browser can dispatch the event, the events are
coalesced so that only one is sent.

You can use an event listener for the toggle event to detect when the
widget changes state:

js

    details.addEventListener("toggle", (event) => {
      if (details.open) {
        /* the element was toggled open */
      } else {
        /* the element was toggled closed */
      }
    });

Examples

A simple disclosure example

This example shows a simple <details> element with a <summary>.

html

    <details>
      <summary>System Requirements</summary>
      <p>
        Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer must have some
        memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage. An input device as well
        as some form of output device is recommended.
      </p>
    </details>

Result

Creating an open disclosure box

To start the <details> box in its open state, add the Boolean open
attribute:

html

    <details open>
      <summary>System Requirements</summary>
      <p>
        Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer must have some
        memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage. An input device as well
        as some form of output device is recommended.
      </p>
    </details>

Result

Customizing the appearance

Now let's apply some CSS to customize the appearance of the disclosure
box.

CSS

css

    details {
      font:
        16px "Open Sans",
        Calibri,
        sans-serif;
      width: 620px;
    }

    details > summary {
      padding: 2px 6px;
      width: 15em;
      background-color: #ddd;
      border: none;
      box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px black;
      cursor: pointer;
    }

    details > p {
      border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;
      background-color: #ddd;
      padding: 2px 6px;
      margin: 0;
      box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px black;
    }

    details[open] > summary {
      background-color: #ccf;
    }

This CSS creates a look similar to a tabbed interface, where clicking
the tab opens it to reveal its contents.

The selector details[open] can be used to style the element which is
open.

HTML

html

    <details>
      <summary>System Requirements</summary>
      <p>
        Requires a computer running an operating system. The computer must have some
        memory and ideally some kind of long-term storage. An input device as well
        as some form of output device is recommended.
      </p>
    </details>

Result

Customizing the disclosure widget

The disclosure triangle itself can be customized, although this is not
as broadly supported. There are variations in how browsers support this
customization due to experimental implementations as the element was
standardized, so we'll have to use multiple approaches for a while.

The <summary> element supports the list-style shorthand property and its
longhand properties, such as list-style-type, to change the disclosure
triangle to whatever you choose (usually with list-style-image). For
example, we can remove the disclosure widget icon by setting
list-style: none.

CSS

css

    details {
      font:
        16px "Open Sans",
        Calibri,
        sans-serif;
      width: 620px;
    }

    details > summary {
      padding: 2px 6px;
      width: 15em;
      background-color: #ddd;
      border: none;
      box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px black;
      cursor: pointer;
      list-style: none;
    }

    details > p {
      border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;
      background-color: #ddd;
      padding: 2px 6px;
      margin: 0;
      box-shadow: 3px 3px 4px black;
    }

This CSS creates a look similar to a tabbed interface, where activating
the tab expands and opens it to reveal its contents.

HTML

    <details>
      <summary>System Requirements</summary>
      <p>

# <dfn>: The Definition element#

The <dfn> HTML element indicates a term to be defined. The <dfn> element
should be used in a complete definition statement, where the ancestor
<p> element, the <dt>/<dd> pairing, or the nearest <section> ancestor of
the <dfn> element, is considered to be the full definition of the term.

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

The title attribute has special meaning, as noted below.

Usage notes

There are some not-entirely-obvious aspects to using the <dfn> element.
We examine those here.

Specifying the term being defined

The term being defined is identified following these rules:

1.  If the <dfn> element has a title attribute, the value of the title
    attribute is considered to be the term being defined. The element
    must still have text within it, but that text may be an abbreviation
    (perhaps using <abbr>) or another form of the term.
2.  If the <dfn> contains a single child element and does not have any
    text content of its own, and the child element is an <abbr> element
    with a title attribute itself, then the exact value of the <abbr>
    element's title is the term being defined.
3.  Otherwise, the text content of the <dfn> element is the term being
    defined. This is shown in the first example below.

Note: If the <dfn> element has a title attribute, it must contain the
term being defined and no other text.

Links to <dfn> elements

If you include an id attribute on the <dfn> element, you can then link
to it using <a> elements. Such links should be uses of the term, with
the intent being that the reader can quickly navigate to the term's
definition if they're not already aware of it, by clicking on the term's
link.

This is shown in the example under Links to definitions below.

Examples

Let's take a look at some examples of various usage scenarios.

Basic identification of a term

This example uses a plain <dfn> element to identify the location of a
term within the definition.

HTML

html

    <p>
      The <strong>HTML Definition element (<dfn>&lt;dfn&gt;</dfn>)</strong> is used
      to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase
      or sentence.
    </p>

Since the <dfn> element has no title, the text contents of the <dfn>
element itself are used as the term being defined.

Result

Links to definitions

To add links to the definitions, you create the link the same way you
always do, with the <a> element.

HTML

html

    <p>
      The
      <strong>HTML Definition element (<dfn id="definition-dfn">&lt;dfn&gt;</dfn>)</strong>
      is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition
      phrase or sentence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Graece donan, Latine
      voluptatem vocant. Confecta res esset. Duo Reges: constructio interrete.
      Scrupulum, inquam, abeunti;
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of all of that, we decided to use the
      <code><a href="#definition-dfn">&lt;dfn&gt;</a></code> element for this
      project.
    </p>

Here we see the definition — now with an id attribute, "definition-dfn",
which can be used as the target of a link. Later on, a link is created
using <a> with the href attribute set to "#definition-dfn" to set up the
link back to the definition.

Result

Using abbreviations and definitions together

In some cases, you may wish to use an abbreviation for a term when
defining it. This can be done by using the <dfn> and <abbr> elements in
tandem, like this:

HTML

html

    <p>
      The <dfn><abbr title="Hubble Space Telescope">HST</abbr></dfn> is among the
      most productive scientific instruments ever constructed. It has been in orbit
      for over 20 years, scanning the sky and returning data and photographs of
      unprecedented quality and detail.
    </p>

    <p>
      Indeed, the <abbr title="Hubble Space Telescope">HST</abbr> has arguably done
      more to advance science than any device ever built.
    </p>

Note the <abbr> element nested inside the <dfn>. The former establishes
that the term is an abbreviation ("HST") and specifies the full term
("Hubble Space Telescope") in its title attribute. The latter indicates
that the abbreviated term represents a term being defined.

The <dialog> HTML element represents a modal or non-modal dialog box or
other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or
subwindow.

The HTML <dialog> element is used to create both modal and non-modal
dialog boxes. Modal dialog boxes interrupt interaction with the rest of
the page being inert, while non-modal dialog boxes allow interaction
with the rest of the page.

JavaScript should be used to display the <dialog> element. Use the
.showModal() method to display a modal dialog and the .show() method to
display a non-modal dialog. The dialog box can be closed using the
.close() method or using the dialog method when submitting a <form> that
is nested within the <dialog> element. Modal dialogs can also be closed
by pressing the Esc key.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

Warning: The tabindex attribute must not be used on the <dialog>
element. See usage notes.

open

    Indicates that the dialog box is active and is available for
    interaction. If the open attribute is not set, the dialog box will
    not be visible to the user. It is recommended to use the .show() or
    .showModal() method to render dialogs, rather than the open
    attribute. If a <dialog> is opened using the open attribute, it is
    non-modal.

    Note: While you can toggle between the open and closed states of
    non-modal dialog boxes by toggling the presence of the open
    attribute, this approach is not recommended.

Usage notes

-   HTML <form> elements can be used to close a dialog box if they have
    the attribute method="dialog" or if the button used to submit the
    form has formmethod="dialog" set. When a <form> within a <dialog> is
    submitted via the dialog method, the dialog box closes, the states
    of the form controls are saved but not submitted, and the
    returnValue property gets set to the value of the button that was
    activated.
-   The CSS ::backdrop pseudo-element can be used to style the backdrop
    of a modal dialog, which is displayed behind the <dialog> element
    when the dialog is displayed using the HTMLDialogElement.showModal()
    method. For example, this pseudo-element could be used to blur,
    darken, or otherwise obfuscate the inert content behind the modal
    dialog.
-   The autofocus attribute should be added to the element the user is
    expected to interact with immediately upon opening a modal dialog.
    If no other element involves more immediate interaction, it is
    recommended to add autofocus to the close button inside the dialog,
    or the dialog itself if the user is expected to click/activate it to
    dismiss.
-   Do not add the tabindex property to the <dialog> element as it is
    not interactive and does not receive focus. The dialog's contents,
    including the close button contained in the dialog, can receive
    focus and be interactive.

Examples

HTML-only dialog

This example demonstrates the create a non-modal dialog by using only
HTML. Because of the boolean open attribute in the <dialog> element, the
dialog appears open when the page loads. The dialog can be closed by
clicking the "OK" button because the method attribute in the <form>
element is set to "dialog". In this case, no JavaScript is needed to
close the form.

html

    <dialog open>
      <p>Greetings, one and all!</p>
      <form method="dialog">
        <button>OK</button>
      </form>
    </dialog>

Result

Note: Reload the page to reset the output.

This dialog is initially open because of the presence of the open
attribute. Dialogs that are displayed using the open attribute are
non-modal. After clicking "OK", the dialog gets dismissed, leaving the
Result frame empty. When the dialog is dismissed, there is no method
provided to reopen it. For this reason, the preferred method to display
non-modal dialogs is by using the HTMLDialogElement.show() method. It is
possible to toggle the display of the dialog by adding or removing the
boolean open attribute, but it is not the recommended practice.

Creating a modal dialog

This example demonstrates a modal dialog with a gradient backdrop. The
.showModal() method opens the modal dialog when the "Show the dialog"
button is activated. The dialog can be closed by pressing the Esc key or
via the close() method when the "Close" button within the dialog is
activated.

When a dialog opens, the browser, by default, gives focus to the first
element that can be focused within the dialog. In this example, the
autofocus attribute is applied to the "Close" button, giving it focus
when the dialog opens, as this is the element we expect the user will
interact with immediately after the dialog opens.

HTML

html

    <dialog>
      <button autofocus>Close</button>
      <p>This modal dialog has a groovy backdrop!</p>
    </dialog>
    <button>Show the dialog</button>

CSS

We can style the backdrop of the dialog by using the ::backdrop
pseudo-element.

css

    ::backdrop {
      background-image: linear-gradient(
        45deg,
        magenta,
        rebeccapurple,
        dodgerblue,
        green
      );
      opacity: 0.75;
    }

JavaScript

The dialog is opened modally using the .showModal() method and closed
using the .close() method.

js

    const dialog = document.querySelector("dialog");
    const showButton = document.querySelector("dialog + button");
    const closeButton = document.querySelector("dialog button");

    // "Show the dialog" button opens the dialog modally
    showButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
      dialog.showModal();
    });

    // "Close" button closes the dialog
    closeButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
      dialog.close();
    });

Result

When the modal dialog is displayed, it appears above any other dialogs
that might be present. Everything outside the modal dialog is inert and
interactions outside the dialog are blocked. Notice that when the dialog
is open, with the exception of the dialog itself, interaction with the
document is not possible; the "Show the dialog" button is mostly
obfuscated by the almost opaque backdrop of the dialog and is inert.

Handling the return value from the dialog

This example demonstrates the returnValue of the <dialog> element and
how to close a modal dialog by using a form. By default, the returnValue
is the empty string or the value of the button that submits the form
within the <dialog> element, if there is one.

This example opens a modal dialog when the "Show the dialog" button is
activated. The dialog contains a form with a <select> and two <button>
elements, which default to type="submit". An event listener updates the
value of the "Confirm" button when the select option changes. If the
"Confirm" button is activated to close the dialog, the current value of
the button is the return value. If the dialog is closed by pressing the
"Cancel" button, the returnValue is cancel.

When the dialog is closed, the return value is displayed under the "Show
the dialog" button. If the dialog is closed by pressing the Esc key, the
returnValue is not updated, and the close event doesn't occur, so the
text in the <output> is not updated.

HTML

html

    <!-- A modal dialog containing a form -->
    <dialog id="favDialog">
      <form>
        <p>
          <label>
            Favorite animal:
            <select>
              <option value="default">Choose…</option>
              <option>Brine shrimp</option>

      </form>
    </dialog>
    <p>
      <button id="showDialog">Show the dialog</button>
    </p>
    <output></output>

JavaScript

js

    const showButton = document.getElementById("showDialog");
    const favDialog = document.getElementById("favDialog");
    const outputBox = document.querySelector("output");
    const selectEl = favDialog.querySelector("select");
    const confirmBtn = favDialog.querySelector("#confirmBtn");

    // "Show the dialog" button opens the <dialog> modally
    showButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
      favDialog.showModal();
    });

    // "Favorite animal" input sets the value of the submit button
    selectEl.addEventListener("change", (e) => {
      confirmBtn.value = selectEl.value;
    });

    // "Cancel" button closes the dialog without submitting because of [formmethod="dialog"], triggering a close event.
    favDialog.addEventListener("close", (e) => {
      outputBox.value =
        favDialog.returnValue === "default"
          ? "No return value."
          : `ReturnValue: ${favDialog.returnValue}.`; // Have to check for "default" rather than empty string
    });

    // Prevent the "confirm" button from the default behavior of submitting the form, and close the dialog with the `close()` method, which triggers the "close" event.
    confirmBtn.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
      event.preventDefault(); // We don't want to submit this fake form
      favDialog.close(selectEl.value); // Have to send the select box value here.
    });

Result

The above examples demonstrate the following three methods of closing
modal dialogs:

-   By submitting the form within the dialog form using the dialog
    method (as seen in the HTML-only example).
-   By pressing the Esc key.
-   By calling the HTMLDialogElement.close() method (as seen in the
    modal example). In this example, the "Cancel" button closes the
    dialog via the dialog form method and the "Confirm" button closes
    the dialog via the HTMLDialogElement.close() method.

The "Cancel" button includes the formmethod="dialog" attribute, which
overrides the <form>'s default GET method. When a form's method is
dialog, the state of the form is saved but not submitted, and the dialog
gets closed.

Without an action, submitting the form via the default GET method causes
a page to reload. We use JavaScript to prevent the submission and close
the dialog with the event.preventDefault() and HTMLDialogElement.close()
methods, respectively.

It is important to provide a closing mechanism within every dialog
element. The Esc key does not close non-modal dialogs by default, nor
can one assume that a user will even have access to a physical keyboard
(e.g., someone using a touch screen device without access to a
keyboard).

Closing a dialog with a required form input

When a form inside a dialog has a required input, the user agent will
only let you close the dialog once you provide a value for the required
input. To close such dialog, either use the formnovalidate attribute on
the close button or call the close() method on the dialog object when
the close button is clicked.

html

    <dialog id="dialog">
      <form method="dialog">
        <p>
          <label>
            Favorite animal:
            <input type="text" required />
          </label>
        </p>
        <div>
          <input type="submit" id="normal-close" value="Normal close" />
          <input
            type="submit"
            id="novalidate-close"
            value="Novalidate close"
            formnovalidate />
          <input type="submit" id="js-close" value="JS close" />
        </div>
      </form>
    </dialog>
    <p>
      <button id="show-dialog">Show the dialog</button>
    </p>
    <output></output>

    [type="submit"] {
      margin-right: 1rem;
    }

JavaScript

js

    const showBtn = document.getElementById("show-dialog");
    const dialog = document.getElementById("dialog");
    const jsCloseBtn = dialog.querySelector("#js-close");

    showBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
      dialog.showModal();
    });

    jsCloseBtn.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      dialog.close();
    });

Result

From the output, we see it is impossible to close the dialog using the
Normal close button. But the dialog can be closed if we bypass the form
validation using the formnovalidate attribute on the Cancel button.
Programmatically, dialog.close() will also close such dialog.

Animating dialogs

<dialog>s are set to display: none; when hidden and display: block; when
shown, as well as being removed from / added to the top layer and the
accessibility tree. Therefore, for <dialog> elements to be animated the
display property needs to be animatable. Supporting browsers animate
display with a variation on the discrete animation type. Specifically,
the browser will flip between none and another value of display so that
the animated content is shown for the entire animation duration.

So for example:

-   When animating display from none to block (or another visible
    display value), the value will flip to block at 0% of the animation
    duration so it is visible throughout.
-   When animating display from block (or another visible display value)
    to none, the value will flip to none at 100% of the animation
    duration so it is visible throughout.

Note: When animating using CSS transitions,
transition-behavior: allow-discrete needs to be set to enable the above
behavior. This behavior is available by default when animating with CSS
animations; an equivalent step is not required.

Transitioning dialog elements

When animating <dialog>s with CSS transitions, the following features
are required:

@starting-style at-rule

    Provides a set of starting values for properties set on the <dialog>
    that you want to transition from every time it is opened. This is
    needed to avoid unexpected behavior. By default, CSS transitions
    only occur when a property changes from one value to another on a
    visible element; they are not triggered on elements' first style
    updates, or when the display type changes from none to another type.

display property

    Add display to the transitions list so that the <dialog> will remain
    as display: block (or another visible display value set on the
    dialog's open state) for the duration of the transition, ensuring
    the other transitions are visible.

overlay property

    Include overlay in the transitions list to ensure the removal of the
    <dialog> from the top layer is deferred until the transition
    completes, again ensuring the transition is visible.

transition-behavior property

    Set transition-behavior: allow-discrete on the display and overlay
    transitions (or on the transition shorthand) to enable discrete
    transitions on these two properties that are not by default
    animatable.

Here is a quick example to show what this might look like.

HTML

The HTML contains a <dialog> element, plus a button to show the dialog.
Additionally, the <dialog> element contains another button to close
itself.

html

    <dialog id="dialog">
      Content here
      <button class="close">close</button>
    </dialog>

    <button class="show">Show Modal</button>

CSS

In the CSS, we include a @starting-style block that defines the
transition starting styles for the opacity and transform properties,
transition end styles on the dialog[open] state, and default styles on
the default dialog state to transition back to once the <dialog> has
appeared. Note how the <dialog>'s transition list includes not only
these properties, but also the display and overlay properties, each with
allow-discrete set on them.

We also set a starting style value for the background-color property on
the ::backdrop that appears behind the <dialog> when it opens, to
provide a nice darkening animation. The dialog[open]::backdrop selector
selects only the backdrops of <dialog> elements when the dialog is open.

css

    /*   Open state of the dialog  */
    dialog[open] {
      opacity: 1;
      transform: scaleY(1);
    }

    /*   Closed state of the dialog   */
    dialog {
      opacity: 0;
      transform: scaleY(0);
      transition:
        opacity 0.7s ease-out,
        transform 0.7s ease-out,
        overlay 0.7s ease-out allow-discrete,
        display 0.7s ease-out allow-discrete;
      /* Equivalent to
      transition: all 0.7s allow-discrete; */
    }

    /*   Before-open state  */
    /* Needs to be after the previous dialog[open] rule to take effect,
        as the specificity is the same */
    @starting-style {
      dialog[open] {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: scaleY(0);
      }
    }

    /* Transition the :backdrop when the dialog modal is promoted to the top layer */
    dialog::backdrop {
      background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0%);
      transition:
        display 0.7s allow-discrete,
        overlay 0.7s allow-discrete,
        background-color 0.7s;
      /* Equivalent to
      transition: all 0.7s allow-discrete; */
    }

    dialog[open]::backdrop {
      background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 25%);
    }

    /* This starting-style rule cannot be nested inside the above selector
    because the nesting selector cannot represent pseudo-elements. */

    @starting-style {
      dialog[open]::backdrop {
        background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0%);
      }
    }

JavaScript

The JavaScript adds event handlers to the show and close buttons causing
them to show and close the <dialog> when they are clicked:

js

    const dialogElem = document.getElementById("dialog");
    const showBtn = document.querySelector(".show");
    const closeBtn = document.querySelector(".close");

    showBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
      dialogElem.showModal();
    });

    closeBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
      dialogElem.close();
    });

Result

The code renders as follows:

Note: Because <dialog>s change from display: none to display: block each
time they are shown, the <dialog> transitions from its @starting-style
styles to its dialog[open] styles every time the entry transition
occurs. When the <dialog> closes, it transitions from its dialog[open]
state to the default dialog state.

It is possible for the style transition on entry and exit to be
different in such cases. See our Demonstration of when starting styles
are used example for a proof of this.

dialog keyframe animations

When animating a <dialog> with CSS keyframe animations, there are some
differences to note from transitions:

-   You don't provide a @starting-style.
-   You include the display value in a keyframe; this will be the
    display value for the entirety of the animation, or until another
    non-none display value is encountered.
-   You don't need to explicitly enable discrete animations; there is no
    equivalent to allow-discrete inside keyframes.
-   You don't need to set overlay inside keyframes either; the display
    animation handles the animation of the <dialog> from shown to
    hidden.

Let's have a look at an example so you can see what this looks like.

HTML

First, the HTML contains a <dialog> element, plus a button to show the
dialog. Additionally, the <dialog> element contains another button to
close itself.

html

    <dialog id="dialog">
      Content here
      <button class="close">close</button>
    </dialog>

    <button class="show">Show Modal</button>

CSS

The CSS defines keyframes to animate between the closed and shown states
of the <dialog>, plus the fade-in animation for the <dialog>'s backdrop.
The <dialog> animations include animating display to make sure the
actual visible animation effects remain visible for the whole duration.
Note that it wasn't possible to animate the backdrop fade out — the
backdrop is immediately removed from the DOM when the <dialog> is
closed, so there is nothing to animate.

css

    dialog {
      animation: fade-out 0.7s ease-out;
    }

    dialog[open] {
      animation: fade-in 0.7s ease-out;
    }

    dialog[open]::backdrop {
      animation: backdrop-fade-in 0.7s ease-out forwards;
    }

    /* Animation keyframes */

    @keyframes fade-in {
      0% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: scaleY(0);
        display: none;
      }

      100% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: scaleY(1);
        display: block;
      }
    }

    @keyframes fade-out {
      0% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: scaleY(1);
        display: block;
      }

      100% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: scaleY(0);
        display: none;
      }
    }

    @keyframes backdrop-fade-in {
      0% {
        background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0%);
      }

      100% {
        background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 25%);
      }
    }

    body,
    button {
      font-family: system-ui;
    }

JavaScript

Finally, the JavaScript adds event handlers to the buttons to enable
showing and closing the <dialog>:

js

    const dialogElem = document.getElementById("dialog");
    const showBtn = document.querySelector(".show");
    const closeBtn = document.querySelector(".close");

    showBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
      dialogElem.showModal();
    });

    closeBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
      dialogElem.close();
    });

Result

The code renders as follows:

Accessibility concerns

When implementing a dialog, it is important to consider the most
appropriate place to set user focus. When using
HTMLDialogElement.showModal() to open a <dialog>, focus is set on the
first nested focusable element. Explicitly indicating the initial focus
placement by using the autofocus attribute will help ensure initial
focus is set on the element deemed the best initial focus placement for
any particular dialog. When in doubt, as it may not always be known
where initial focus could be set within a dialog, particularly for
instances where a dialog's content is dynamically rendered when invoked,
the <dialog> element itself may provide the best initial focus
placement.

Ensure a mechanism is provided to allow users to close the dialog. The
most robust way to ensure that all users can close the dialog is to
include an explicit button to do so, such as a confirmation,
cancellation, or close button.

By default, a dialog invoked by the showModal() method can be dismissed
by pressing the Esc key. A non-modal dialog does not dismiss via the Esc
key by default, and depending on what the non-modal dialog represents,
it may not be desired for this behavior. Keyboard users expect the Esc
key to close modal dialogs; ensure that this behavior is implemented and
maintained. If multiple modal dialogs are open, pressing the Esc key
should close only the last shown dialog. When using <dialog>, this
behavior is provided by the browser.

While dialogs can be created using other elements, the native <dialog>
element provides usability and accessibility features that must be
replicated if you use other elements for a similar purpose. If you're
creating a custom dialog implementation, ensure that all expected
default behaviors are supported and proper labeling recommendations are
followed.

The <dialog> element is exposed by browsers in a manner similar to
custom dialogs that use the ARIA role="dialog" attribute. <dialog>
elements invoked by the showModal() method implicitly have
aria-modal="true", whereas <dialog> elements invoked by the show()
method or displayed using the open attribute or by changing the default
display of a <dialog> are exposed as [aria-modal="false"]. When
implementing modal dialogs, everything other than the <dialog> and its
contents should be rendered inert using the inert attribute. When using
<dialog> along with the HTMLDialogElement.showModal() method, this
behavior is provided by the browser.

# <dir>: The Directory element#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <dir> HTML element is used as a container for a directory of files
and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the user
agent. Do not use this obsolete element; instead, you should use the
<ul> element for lists, including lists of files.

Warning: Do not use this element. Though present in early HTML
specifications, it has been deprecated in HTML 4, and has since been
removed entirely. No major browsers support this element.

DOM interface

This element implements the HTMLDirectoryElement interface.

Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global
attributes.

compact Deprecated

    This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a
    compact style. The interpretation of this attribute depends on the
    user agent and it doesn't work in all browsers.

Specifications

# <div>: The Content Division element#

The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has
no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS
(e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model
like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).

%html-content%

As a "pure" container, the <div> element does not inherently represent
anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled
using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a document as
being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so
on.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

Note: The align attribute is obsolete; do not use it anymore. Instead,
you should use CSS properties or techniques such as CSS Grid or CSS
Flexbox to align and position <div> elements on the page.

Usage notes

-   The <div> element should be used only when no other semantic element
    (such as <article> or <nav>) is appropriate.

Accessibility concerns

The <div> element has an implicit role of generic, and not none. This
may affect certain ARIA combination declarations that expect a direct
descendant element with a certain role to function properly.

Examples

A simple example

html

    <div>
      <p>
        Any kind of content here. Such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;table&gt;. You name it!

# <dl>: The Description List element#

The <dl> HTML element represents a description list. The element
encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the <dt> element)
and descriptions (provided by <dd> elements). Common uses for this
element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of
key-value pairs).

      <dd>Japan</dd>
      <dt>Color</dt>
      <dd>Green</dd>
    </dl>

Result

Tip: It can be handy to define a key-value separator in the CSS, such
as:

css

    dt::after {
      content: ": ";
    }

Wrapping name-value groups in div elements

WHATWG HTML allows wrapping each name-value group in a <dl> element in a
<div> element. This can be useful when using microdata, or when global
attributes apply to a whole group, or for styling purposes.

html

    <dl>
      <div>
        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>Godzilla</dd>
      </div>
      <div>
        <dt>Born</dt>
        <dd>1952</dd>
      </div>
      <div>
        <dt>Birthplace</dt>
        <dd>Japan</dd>
      </div>
      <div>
        <dt>Color</dt>
        <dd>Green</dd>
      </div>
    </dl>

Result

Notes

Do not use this element (nor <ul> elements) to merely create indentation
on a page. Although it works, this is a bad practice and obscures the
meaning of description lists.

To change the indentation of a description term, use the CSS margin
property.

Accessibility concerns

Each screen reader exposes <dl> content differently, including total
count, terms/definitions context, and navigation methods. These
differences are not necessarily bugs. As of iOS 14, VoiceOver will
announce that <dl> content is a list when navigating with the virtual
cursor (not via the read-all command). VoiceOver does not support list
navigation commands with <dl>. Be careful applying ARIA term and
definition roles to <dl> constructs as VoiceOver (macOS and iOS) will
adjust how they are announced.

# <dt>: The Description Term element#

The <dt> HTML element specifies a term in a description or definition
list, and as such must be used inside a <dl> element. It is usually
followed by a <dd> element; however, multiple <dt> elements in a row
indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next <dd>
element.

The subsequent <dd> (Description Details) element provides the
definition or other related text associated with the term specified
using <dt>.

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

Note: This topic documents only the element that is defined as part of
the HTML Living Standard. It does not address earlier, non-standardized
implementation of the element.

Keep in mind that most modern browsers have deprecated and removed
support for browser plug-ins, so relying upon <embed> is generally not
wise if you want your site to be operable on the average user's browser.

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

height

    The displayed height of the resource, in CSS pixels. This must be an
    absolute value; percentages are not allowed.

src

    The URL of the resource being embedded.

type

    The MIME type to use to select the plug-in to instantiate.

width

    The displayed width of the resource, in CSS pixels. This must be an
    absolute value; percentages are not allowed.

Usage notes

You can use the object-position property to adjust the positioning of
the embedded object within the element's frame, and the object-fit
property to control how the object's size is adjusted to fit within the
frame.

Examples

html

    <embed
      type="video/quicktime"
      src="movie.mov"
      width="640"
      height="480"
      title="Title of my video" />

Accessibility concerns

Use the title attribute on an embed element to label its content so that
people navigating with assistive technology such as a screen reader can
understand what it contains. The title's value should concisely describe
the embedded content. Without a title, they may not be able to determine
what its embedded content is. This context shift can be confusing and
time-consuming, especially if the embed element contains interactive
content like video or audio.

# <em>: The Emphasis element#

The <em> HTML element marks text that has stress emphasis. The <em>
element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater
degree of emphasis.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

The <em> element is for words that have a stressed emphasis compared to
surrounding text, which is often limited to a word or words of a
sentence and affects the meaning of the sentence itself.

Typically this element is displayed in italic type. However, it should
not be used to apply italic styling; use the CSS font-style property for
that purpose. Use the <cite> element to mark the title of a work (book,
play, song, etc.). Use the <i> element to mark text that is in an
alternate tone or mood, which covers many common situations for italics
such as scientific names or words in other languages. Use the <strong>
element to mark text that has greater importance than surrounding text.

<i> vs. <em>

Some developers may be confused by how multiple elements seemingly
produce similar visual results. <em> and <i> are a common example, since
they both italicize text. What's the difference? Which should you use?

By default, the visual result is the same. However, the semantic meaning
is different. The <em> element represents stress emphasis of its
contents, while the <i> element represents text that is set off from the
normal prose, such as a foreign word, fictional character thoughts, or
when the text refers to the definition of a word instead of representing
its semantic meaning. (The title of a work, such as the name of a book
or movie, should use <cite>.)

This means the right one to use depends on the situation. Neither is for
purely decorative purposes, that's what CSS styling is for.

An example for <em> could be: "Just do it already!", or: "We had to do
something about it". A person or software reading the text would
pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

An example for <i> could be: "The Queen Mary sailed last night". Here,
there is no added emphasis or importance on the word "Queen Mary". It is
merely indicated that the object in question is not a queen named Mary,
but a ship named Queen Mary. Another example for <i> could be: "The word
the is an article".

Examples

In this example, the <em> element is used to highlight an implicit or
explicit contrast between two ingredient lists:

html

    <p>
      Ice cream is made with milk, sweetener, and cream. Frozen custard, on the
      other hand, is made of milk, cream, sweetener, and <em>egg yolks</em>.
    </p>

    }

Output

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

As the example above shows, the <fieldset> element provides a grouping
for a part of an HTML form, with a nested <legend> element providing a
caption for the <fieldset>. It takes few attributes, the most notable of
which are form, which can contain the id of a <form> on the same page,
allowing you to make the <fieldset> part of that <form> even if it is
not nested inside it, and disabled, which allows you to disable the
<fieldset> and all its contents in one go.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

disabled

    If this Boolean attribute is set, all form controls that are
    descendants of the <fieldset>, are disabled, meaning they are not
    editable and won't be submitted along with the <form>. They won't
    receive any browsing events, like mouse clicks or focus-related
    events. By default browsers display such controls grayed out. Note
    that form elements inside the <legend> element won't be disabled.

form

    This attribute takes the value of the id attribute of a <form>
    element you want the <fieldset> to be part of, even if it is not
    inside the form. Please note that usage of this is confusing — if
    you want the <input> elements inside the <fieldset> to be associated
    with the form, you need to use the form attribute directly on those
    elements. You can check which elements are associated with a form
    via JavaScript, using HTMLFormElement.elements.

name

    The name associated with the group.

    Note: The caption for the fieldset is given by the first <legend>
    element nested inside it.

Styling with CSS

There are several special styling considerations for <fieldset>.

Its display value is block by default, and it establishes a block
formatting context. If the <fieldset> is styled with an inline-level
display value, it will behave as inline-block, otherwise it will behave
as block. By default there is a 2px groove border surrounding the
contents, and a small amount of default padding. The element has
min-inline-size: min-content by default.

If a <legend> is present, it is placed over the block-start border. The
<legend> shrink-wraps, and also establishes a formatting context. The
display value is blockified. (For example, display: inline behaves as
block.)

There will be an anonymous box holding the contents of the <fieldset>,
which inherits certain properties from the <fieldset>. If the <fieldset>
is styled with display: grid or display: inline-grid, then the anonymous
box will be a grid formatting context. If the <fieldset> is styled with
display: flex or display: inline-flex, then the anonymous box will be a
flex formatting context. Otherwise, it establishes a block formatting
context.

You can feel free to style the <fieldset> and <legend> in any way you
want to suit your page design.

Examples

Simple fieldset

This example shows a really simple <fieldset> example, with a <legend>,
and a single control inside it.

html

    <form action="#">
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Do you agree?</legend>
        <input type="checkbox" id="chbx" name="agree" value="Yes!" />
        <label for="chbx">I agree</label>
      </fieldset>
    </form>

Result

Disabled fieldset

This example shows a disabled <fieldset> with two controls inside it.
Note how both the controls are disabled due to being inside a disabled
<fieldset>.

html

    <form action="#">
      <fieldset disabled>
        <legend>Disabled login fieldset</legend>
        <div>
          <label for="name">Name: </label>
          <input type="text" id="name" value="Chris" />
        </div>
        <div>

    can be moved to another part of the document or to an appendix
    without affecting the main flow.
-   A caption can be associated with the <figure> element by inserting a
    <figcaption> inside it (as the first or the last child). The first
    <figcaption> element found in the figure is presented as the
    figure's caption.

# <font>#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <font> HTML element defines the font size, color and face for its
content.

Warning: Do not use this element. Use the CSS Fonts properties to style
text.

Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global
attributes.

color Deprecated

    This attribute sets the text color using either a named color or a
    color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.

face Deprecated

    This attribute contains a comma-separated list of one or more font
    names. The document text in the default style is rendered in the
    first font face that the client's browser supports. If no font
    listed is installed on the local system, the browser typically
    defaults to the proportional or fixed-width font for that system.

size Deprecated

    This attribute specifies the font size as either a numeric or
    relative value. Numeric values range from 1 to 7 with 1 being the
    smallest and 3 the default. It can be defined using a relative
    value, like +2 or -3, which sets it relative to 3, the default
    value.

DOM interface

This element implements the HTMLFontElement interface.

Prior to the release of Safari 13, the contentinfo landmark role was not
properly exposed by VoiceOver. If needing to support legacy Safari
browsers, add role="contentinfo" to the footer element to ensure the
landmark will be properly exposed.

%html-content%

It is possible to use the :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes to
style a <form> element based on whether the elements inside the form are
valid.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

accept Deprecated

    Comma-separated content types the server accepts.

    Note: This attribute has been deprecated and should not be used.
    Instead, use the accept attribute on <input type=file> elements.

accept-charset

    Space-separated character encodings the server accepts. The browser
    uses them in the order in which they are listed. The default value
    means the same encoding as the page. (In previous versions of HTML,
    character encodings could also be delimited by commas.)

autocapitalize

    Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if
    so, in what manner. See the autocapitalize global attribute page for
    more information.

autocomplete

    Indicates whether input elements can by default have their values
    automatically completed by the browser. autocomplete attributes on
    form elements override it on <form>. Possible values:

    -   off: The browser may not automatically complete entries.
        (Browsers tend to ignore this for suspected login forms; see The
        autocomplete attribute and login fields.)
    -   on: The browser may automatically complete entries.

name

    The name of the form. The value must not be the empty string, and
    must be unique among the form elements in the forms collection that
    it is in, if any.

rel

    Controls the annotations and what kinds of links the form creates.
    Annotations include external, nofollow, opener, noopener, and
    noreferrer. Link types include help, prev, next, search, and
    license. The rel value is a space-separated list of these enumerated
    values.

Attributes for form submission

The following attributes control behavior during form submission.

action

    The URL that processes the form submission. This value can be
    overridden by a formaction attribute on a <button>,
    <input type="submit">, or <input type="image"> element. This
    attribute is ignored when method="dialog" is set.

enctype

    If the value of the method attribute is post, enctype is the MIME
    type of the form submission. Possible values:

    -   application/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value.
    -   multipart/form-data: Use this if the form contains <input>
        elements with type=file.
    -   text/plain: Useful for debugging purposes.

    This value can be overridden by formenctype attributes on <button>,
    <input type="submit">, or <input type="image"> elements.

method

    The HTTP method to submit the form with. The only allowed
    methods/values are (case insensitive):

    -   post: The POST method; form data sent as the request body.
    -   get (default): The GET; form data appended to the action URL
        with a ? separator. Use this method when the form has no side
        effects.
    -   dialog: When the form is inside a <dialog>, closes the dialog
        and causes a submit event to be fired on submission, without
        submitting data or clearing the form.

    This value is overridden by formmethod attributes on <button>,
    <input type="submit">, or <input type="image"> elements.

novalidate

    This Boolean attribute indicates that the form shouldn't be
    validated when submitted. If this attribute is not set (and
    therefore the form is validated), it can be overridden by a
    formnovalidate attribute on a <button>, <input type="submit">, or
    <input type="image"> element belonging to the form.

target

    Indicates where to display the response after submitting the form.
    It is a name/keyword for a browsing context (for example, tab,
    window, or iframe). The following keywords have special meanings:

    -   _self (default): Load into the same browsing context as the
        current one.
    -   _blank: Load into a new unnamed browsing context. This provides
        the same behavior as setting rel="noopener" which does not set
        window.opener.
    -   _parent: Load into the parent browsing context of the current
        one. If no parent, behaves the same as _self.
    -   _top: Load into the top-level browsing context (i.e., the
        browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one and has
        no parent). If no parent, behaves the same as _self.

    This value can be overridden by a formtarget attribute on a
    <button>, <input type="submit">, or <input type="image"> element.

Examples

html

    <!-- Form which will send a GET request to the current URL -->
    <form method="get">
      <label>
        Name:
        <input name="submitted-name" autocomplete="name" />

# <frame>#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <frame> HTML element defines a particular area in which another HTML
document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a <frameset>.

Using the <frame> element is not encouraged because of certain
disadvantages such as performance problems and lack of accessibility for
users with screen readers. Instead of the <frame> element, <iframe> may
be preferred.

Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global
attributes.

src Deprecated

    This attribute specifies the document that will be displayed by the
    frame.

name Deprecated

    This attribute is used for labeling frames. Without labeling, every
    link will open in the frame that it's in – the closest parent frame.
    See the target attribute for more information.

noresize Deprecated

    This attribute prevents resizing of frames by users.

scrolling Deprecated

    This attribute defines the existence of a scrollbar. If this
    attribute is not used, the browser adds a scrollbar when necessary.
    There are two choices: "yes" for forcing a scrollbar even when it is
    not necessary and "no" for forcing no scrollbar even when it is
    necessary.

marginheight Deprecated

    This attribute defines the height of the margin between frames.

marginwidth Deprecated

    This attribute defines the width of the margin between frames.

frameborder Deprecated

    This attribute allows you to specify a frame's border.

Example

A frameset document

A frameset document has a <frameset> element instead of a <body>
element. The <frame> elements are placed within the <frameset>.

html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <!-- Document metadata goes here -->
      </head>
      <frameset cols="400, 500">
        <frame src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/iframe" />
        <frame src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/frame" />
      </frameset>
    </html>

If you want to embed another HTML page into the <body> of a document,
use an <iframe> element.

The <frameset> HTML element is used to contain <frame> elements.

Note: Because the use of frames is now discouraged in favor of using
<iframe>, this element is not typically used by modern websites.

Usage notes

The <header> element has an identical meaning to the site-wide banner
landmark role, unless nested within sectioning content. Then, the
<header> element is not a landmark.

The <header> element can define a global site header, described as a
banner in the accessibility tree. It usually includes a logo, company
name, search feature, and possibly the global navigation or a slogan. It
is generally located at the top of the page.

Otherwise, it is a section in the accessibility tree, and usually
contains the surrounding section's heading (an h1 – h6 element) and
optional subheading, but this is not required.

Historical Usage

The <header> element originally existed at the very beginning of HTML
for headings. It is seen in the very first website. At some point,
headings became <h1> through <h6>, allowing <header> to be free to fill
a different role.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

# <h1>–<h6>: The HTML Section Heading elements#

The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings.
<h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest. By default,
all heading elements create a block-level box in the layout, starting on
a new line and taking up the full width available in their containing
block.

Usage notes

-   Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table
    of contents for a document automatically.
-   Do not use heading elements to resize text. Instead, use the CSS
    font-size property.
-   Do not skip heading levels: always start from <h1>, followed by <h2>
    and so on.

Avoid using multiple <h1> elements on one page

While using multiple <h1> elements on one page is allowed by the HTML
standard (as long as they are not nested), this is not considered a best
practice. A page should generally have a single <h1> element that
describes the content of the page (similar to the document's
<title> element).

Note: Nesting multiple <h1> elements in nested sectioning elements was
allowed in older versions of the HTML standard. However, this was never
considered a best practice and is now non-conforming. Read more in There
Is No Document Outline Algorithm.

Prefer using only one <h1> per page and nest headings without skipping
levels.

Examples

All headings

The following code shows all the heading levels, in use.

html

    <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading level 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading level 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading level 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading level 6</h6>

Navigation

A common navigation technique for users of screen reading software is to
quickly jump from heading to heading in order to determine the content
of the page. Because of this, it is important to not skip one or more
heading levels. Doing so may create confusion, as the person navigating
this way may be left wondering where the missing heading is.

Don't do this:

html

    <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
    <h3>Heading level 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading level 4</h4>

Prefer this:

html

    <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading level 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading level 3</h3>

Nesting

Headings may be nested as subsections to reflect the organization of the
content of the page. Most screen readers can also generate an ordered
list of all the headings on a page, which can help a person quickly
determine the hierarchy of the content:

1.  h1 Beetles
    1.  h2 Etymology
    2.  h2 Distribution and Diversity
    3.  h2 Evolution
        1.  h3 Late Paleozoic
        2.  h3 Jurassic
        3.  h3 Cretaceous
        4.  h3 Cenozoic
    4.  h2 External Morphology
        1.  h3 Head
            1.  h4 Mouthparts
        2.  h3 Thorax
            1.  h4 Prothorax
            2.  h4 Pterothorax
        3.  h3 Legs
        4.  h3 Wings
        5.  h3 Abdomen

When headings are nested, heading levels may be "skipped" when closing a
subsection.

Labeling section content

Another common navigation technique for users of screen reading software
is to generate a list of sectioning content and use it to determine the
page's layout.

Sectioning content can be labeled using a combination of the
aria-labelledby and id attributes, with the label concisely describing
the purpose of the section. This technique is useful for situations
where there is more than one sectioning element on the same page.

Sectioning content examples

html

    <header>
      <nav aria-labelledby="primary-navigation">
        <h2 id="primary-navigation">Primary navigation</h2>
        <!-- navigation items -->
      </nav>
    </header>

    <!-- page content -->

    <footer>
      <nav aria-labelledby="footer-navigation">
        <h2 id="footer-navigation">Footer navigation</h2>
        <!-- navigation items -->
      </nav>
    </footer>

In this example, screen reading technology would announce that there are
two <nav> sections, one called "Primary navigation" and one called
"Footer navigation". If labels were not provided, the person using
screen reading software may have to investigate each nav element's
contents to determine their purpose.

# <hgroup>: The Heading Group element#

The <hgroup> HTML element represents a heading and related content. It
groups a single <h1>–<h6> element with one or more <p>.

    </hgroup>
    <p>
      Victor Frankenstein, a Swiss scientist, has a great ambition: to create intelligent life. But when his creature first
      stirs, he realizes he has made a monster. A monster which, abandoned by his master and shunned by everyone who sees
      it, follows Dr Frankenstein to the very ends of the earth.

Note: The <hgroup> element is not recommended as it does not work
properly with assistive technologies. It was removed from the W3C HTML
specification but is still part of the WHATWG specification and is at
least partially supported by most browsers.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

The <hgroup> element allows the grouping of a heading with any secondary
content, such as subheadings, an alternative title, or tagline. Each of
these types of content represented as a <p> element within the <hgroup>.

The <hgroup> itself has no impact on the document outline of a web page.
Rather, the single allowed heading within the <hgroup> contributes to
the document outline.

Examples

html

    <!doctype html>
    <title>HTML Standard</title>
    <body>
      <hgroup id="document-title">
        <h1>HTML: Living Standard</h1>
        <p>Last Updated 12 July 2022</p>
      </hgroup>
      <p>Some intro to the document.</p>
      <h2>Table of contents</h2>
      <ol id="toc">
        …
      </ol>
      <h2>First section</h2>
      <p>Some intro to the first section.</p>
    </body>

Accessibility concerns

The <hgroup> presently has no strong accessibility semantics. The
content of the element (a heading and optional paragraphs) is what is
exposed by browser accessibility APIs.

Historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line.
While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers,
this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than
presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you
should do so using appropriate CSS.

Attributes

This element's attributes include the global attributes.

align Deprecated Non-standard

    Sets the alignment of the rule on the page. If no value is
    specified, the default value is left.

color Deprecated Non-standard

    Sets the color of the rule through color name or hexadecimal value.

noshade Deprecated Non-standard

    Sets the rule to have no shading.

size Deprecated Non-standard

    Sets the height, in pixels, of the rule.

# HTML elements reference#

This page lists all the HTML elements, which are created using tags.

They are grouped by function to help you find what you have in mind
easily. An alphabetical list of all elements is provided in the sidebar
on every element's page as well as this one.

Note: For more information about the basics of HTML elements and
attributes, see the section on elements in the Introduction to HTML
article.

Main root

  Element   Description
  --------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <html>    Represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.

Document metadata

Metadata contains information about the page. This includes information
about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines,
browsers, etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts
may be defined in the page or linked to another file that has the
information.

  Element   Description
  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <base>    Specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document. There can be only one such element in a document.
  <head>    Contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.
  <link>    Specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.
  <meta>    Represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> and <title>.
  <style>   Contains style information for a document or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing this element.
  <title>   Defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.

Sectioning root

  Element   Description
  --------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <body>    represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one such element in a document.

Content sectioning

Content sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content
into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad
outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation,
and heading elements to identify sections of content.

  Element                              Description
  ------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <address>                            Indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.
  <article>                            Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.
  <aside>                              Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
  <footer>                             Represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data, or links to related documents.
  <header>                             Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
  <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>   Represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.
  <hgroup>                             Represents a heading grouped with any secondary content, such as subheadings, an alternative title, or a tagline.
  <main>                               Represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.
  <nav>                                Represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.
  <section>                            Represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.
  <search>                             Represents a part that contains a set of form controls or other content related to performing a search or filtering operation.

Text content

Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content
placed between the opening <body> and closing </body> tags. Important
for accessibility and SEO, these elements identify the purpose or
structure of that content.

  Element        Description
  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <blockquote>   Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <cite> element.
  <dd>           Provides the description, definition, or value for the preceding term (<dt>) in a description list (<dl>).
  <div>          The generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g., styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like flexbox is applied to its parent element).
  <dl>           Represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the <dt> element) and descriptions (provided by <dd> elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).
  <dt>           Specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a <dl> element. It is usually followed by a <dd> element; however, multiple <dt> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next <dd> element.
  <figcaption>   Represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent <figure> element.
  <figure>       Represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the <figcaption> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.
  <hr>           Represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
  <li>           Represents an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (<ol>), an unordered list (<ul>), or a menu (<menu>). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.
  <menu>         A semantic alternative to <ul>, but treated by browsers (and exposed through the accessibility tree) as no different than <ul>. It represents an unordered list of items (which are represented by <li> elements).
  <ol>           Represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list.
  <p>            Represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.
  <pre>          Represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or monospaced, font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.
  <ul>           Represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.

Inline text semantics

Use the HTML inline text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or
style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text.

  Element    Description
  ---------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <a>        Together with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations within the current page, or anything else a URL can address.
  <abbr>     Represents an abbreviation or acronym.
  <b>        Used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the strong element.
  <bdi>      Tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted.
  <bdo>      Overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.
  <br>       Produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.
  <cite>     Used to mark up the title of a cited creative work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.
  <code>     Displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code. By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font.
  <data>     Links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or date-related, the<time> element must be used.
  <dfn>      Used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The ancestor <p> element, the <dt>/<dd> pairing, or the nearest section ancestor of the <dfn> element, is considered to be the definition of the term.
  <em>       Marks text that has stress emphasis. The <em> element can be nested, with each nesting level indicating a greater degree of emphasis.
  <i>        Represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, and taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.
  <kbd>      Represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a <kbd> element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.
  <mark>     Represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.
  <q>        Indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the <blockquote> element.
  <rp>       Used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support the display of ruby annotations using the <ruby> element. One <rp> element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the <rt> element that contains the annotation's text.
  <rt>       Specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The <rt> element must always be contained within a <ruby> element.
  <ruby>     Represents small annotations that are rendered above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common.
  <s>        Renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the del and ins elements, as appropriate.
  <samp>     Used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as Courier or Lucida Console).
  <small>    Represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font size smaller, such as from small to x-small.
  <span>     A generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline-level element.
  <strong>   Indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
  <sub>      Specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.
  <sup>      Specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.
  <time>     Represents a specific period in time. It may include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.
  <u>        Represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline but may be altered using CSS.
  <var>      Represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent.
  <wbr>      Represents a word break opportunity—a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.

Image and multimedia

HTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and
video.

  Element   Description
  --------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <area>    Defines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas. An image map allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with hyperlink.
  <audio>   Used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the source element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.
  <img>     Embeds an image into the document.
  <map>     Used with <area> elements to define an image map (a clickable link area).
  <track>   Used as a child of the media elements, audio and video. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files)—Web Video Text Tracks.
  <video>   Embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can also use <video> for audio content, but the audio element may provide a more appropriate user experience.

Embedded content

In addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can include a variety of
other content, even if it's not always easy to interact with.

  Element     Description
  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <embed>     Embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in.
  <iframe>    Represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one.
  <object>    Represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.
  <picture>   Contains zero or more <source> elements and one <img> element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.
  <portal>    Enables the embedding of another HTML page into the current one to enable smoother navigation into new pages.
  <source>    Specifies multiple media resources for the picture, the audio element, or the video element. It is a void element, meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for image file formats and media file formats.

SVG and MathML

You can embed SVG and MathML content directly into HTML documents, using
the <svg> and <math> elements.

  Element   Description
  --------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <svg>     Container defining a new coordinate system and viewport. It is used as the outermost element of SVG documents, but it can also be used to embed an SVG fragment inside an SVG or HTML document.
  <math>    The top-level element in MathML. Every valid MathML instance must be wrapped in it. In addition, you must not nest a second <math> element in another, but you can have an arbitrary number of other child elements in it.

Scripting

To create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of
scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain elements
support this capability.

  Element      Description
  ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <canvas>     Container element to use with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw graphics and animations.
  <noscript>   Defines a section of HTML to be inserted if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.
  <script>     Used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. The <script> element can also be used with other languages, such as WebGL's GLSL shader programming language and JSON.

Demarcating edits

These elements let you provide indications that specific parts of the
text have been altered.

  Element   Description
  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <del>     Represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The <ins> element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document.
  <ins>     Represents a range of text that has been added to a document. You can use the <del> element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the document.

Table content

The elements here are used to create and handle tabular data.

  Element      Description
  ------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <caption>    Specifies the caption (or title) of a table.
  <col>        Defines one or more columns in a column group represented by its implicit or explicit parent <colgroup> element. The <col> element is only valid as a child of a <colgroup> element that has no span attribute defined.
  <colgroup>   Defines a group of columns within a table.
  <table>      Represents tabular data—that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.
  <tbody>      Encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the body of a table's (main) data.
  <td>         A child of the <tr> element, it defines a cell of a table that contains data.
  <tfoot>      Encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the foot of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually a summary of the columns, e.g., a sum of the given numbers in a column.
  <th>         A child of the <tr> element, it defines a cell as the header of a group of table cells. The nature of this group can be explicitly defined by the scope and headers attributes.
  <thead>      Encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the head of a table with information about the table's columns. This is usually in the form of column headers (<th> elements).
  <tr>         Defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of <td> (data cell) and <th> (header cell) elements.

Forms

HTML provides several elements that can be used together to create forms
that the user can fill out and submit to the website or application.
Further information about this available in the HTML forms guide.

  Element      Description
  ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <button>     An interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.
  <datalist>   Contains a set of <option> elements that represent the permissible or recommended options available to choose from within other controls.
  <fieldset>   Used to group several controls as well as labels (<label>) within a web form.
  <form>       Represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.
  <input>      Used to create interactive controls for web-based forms to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent. The <input> element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.
  <label>      Represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
  <legend>     Represents a caption for the content of its parent <fieldset>.
  <meter>      Represents either a scalar value within a known range or a fractional value.
  <optgroup>   Creates a grouping of options within a <select> element.
  <option>     Used to define an item contained in a select, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.
  <output>     Container element into which a site or app can inject the results of a calculation or the outcome of a user action.
  <progress>   Displays an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar.
  <select>     Represents a control that provides a menu of options.
  <textarea>   Represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example, a comment on a review or feedback form.

Interactive elements

HTML offers a selection of elements that help to create interactive user
interface objects.

  Element     Description
  ----------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <details>   Creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label must be provided using the <summary> element.
  <dialog>    Represents a dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.
  <summary>   Specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a details element's disclosure box. Clicking the <summary> element toggles the state of the parent <details> element open and closed.

Web Components

Web Components is an HTML-related technology that makes it possible to,
essentially, create and use custom elements as if it were regular HTML.
In addition, you can create custom versions of standard HTML elements.

  Element      Description
  ------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <slot>       Part of the Web Components technology suite, this element is a placeholder inside a web component that you can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM trees and present them together.
  <template>   A mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.

Obsolete and deprecated elements

Warning: These are old HTML elements that are deprecated and should not
be used. You should never use them in new projects, and you should
replace them in old projects as soon as you can. They are listed here
for completeness only.

  Element       Description
  ------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <acronym>     Allows authors to clearly indicate a sequence of characters that compose an acronym or abbreviation for a word.
  <big>         Renders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (medium becomes large, for example). The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font size.
  <center>      Displays its block-level or inline contents centered horizontally within its containing element.
  <content>     An obsolete part of the Web Components suite of technologies—was used inside of Shadow DOM as an insertion point, and wasn't meant to be used in ordinary HTML. It has now been replaced by the <slot> element, which creates a point in the DOM at which a shadow DOM can be inserted. Consider using <slot> instead.
  <dir>         Container for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the user agent. Do not use this obsolete element; instead, you should use the <ul> element for lists, including lists of files.
  <font>        Defines the font size, color and face for its content.
  <frame>       Defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a <frameset>.
  <frameset>    Used to contain <frame> elements.
  <image>       An ancient and poorly supported precursor to the <img> element. It should not be used.
  <marquee>     Used to insert a scrolling area of text. You can control what happens when the text reaches the edges of its content area using its attributes.
  <menuitem>    Represents a command that a user is able to invoke through a popup menu. This includes context menus, as well as menus that might be attached to a menu button.
  <nobr>        Prevents the text it contains from automatically wrapping across multiple lines, potentially resulting in the user having to scroll horizontally to see the entire width of the text.
  <noembed>     An obsolete, non-standard way to provide alternative, or "fallback", content for browsers that do not support the embed element or do not support the type of embedded content an author wishes to use. This element was deprecated in HTML 4.01 and above in favor of placing fallback content between the opening and closing tags of an <object> element.
  <noframes>    Provides content to be presented in browsers that don't support (or have disabled support for) the <frame> element. Although most commonly-used browsers support frames, there are exceptions, including certain special-use browsers including some mobile browsers, as well as text-mode browsers.
  <param>       Defines parameters for an <object> element.
  <plaintext>   Renders everything following the start tag as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. There is no closing tag, since everything after it is considered raw text.
  <rb>          Used to delimit the base text component of a ruby annotation, i.e. the text that is being annotated. One <rb> element should wrap each separate atomic segment of the base text.
  <rtc>         Embraces semantic annotations of characters presented in a ruby of <rb> elements used inside of <ruby> element. <rb> elements can have both pronunciation (<rt>) and semantic (<rtc>) annotations.
  <shadow>      An obsolete part of the Web Components technology suite that was intended to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point. You might have used it if you have created multiple shadow roots under a shadow host. Consider using <slot> instead.
  <strike>      Places a strikethrough (horizontal line) over text.
  <tt>          Creates inline text which is presented using the user agent default monospace font face. This element was created for the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed on a fixed-width display such as a teletype, text-only screen, or line printer.
  <xmp>         Renders text between the start and end tags without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font. The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide enough to allow 80 characters per line.

# <html>: The HTML Document / Root element#

The <html> HTML element represents the root (top-level element) of an
HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other
elements must be descendants of this element.

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Content categories                  None.

  Permitted content                   One <head> element, followed by one
                                      <body> element.

  Tag omission                        The start tag may be omitted if the
                                      first thing inside the <html>
                                      element is not a comment.
                                      The end tag may be omitted if the
                                      <html> element is not immediately
                                      followed by a comment.

  Permitted parents                   None. This is the root element of a
                                      document.

  Implicit ARIA role                  document

  Permitted ARIA roles                No role permitted

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

manifest Deprecated Non-standard

    Specifies the URI of a resource manifest indicating resources that
    should be cached locally.

version Deprecated

    Specifies the version of the HTML Document Type Definition that
    governs the current document. This attribute is not needed, because
    it is redundant with the version information in the document type
    declaration.

xmlns

    Specifies the XML Namespace of the document. Default value is
    "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml". This is required in documents parsed
    with XML parsers, and optional in text/html documents.

Example

html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <!-- … -->
      </head>
      <body>
        <!-- … -->
      </body>
    </html>

Accessibility concerns

While HTML does not require authors to specify <html> element start and
ending tags, it is important for authors to do so as it will allow them
to specify the lang for the webpage. Providing a lang attribute with a
valid language tag according to RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages
(also known as BCP 47) on the <html> element will help screen reading
technology determine the proper language to announce. The identifying
language tag should describe the language used by the majority of the
content of the page. Without it, screen readers will typically default
to the operating system's set language, which may cause
mispronunciations.

Including a valid lang declaration on the <html> element also ensures
that important metadata contained in the page's <head>, such as the
page's <title>, are also announced properly.

%html-content%

Each embedded browsing context has its own document and allows URL
navigations. The navigations of each embedded browsing context are
linearized into the session history of the topmost browsing context. The
browsing context that embeds the others is called the parent browsing
context. The topmost browsing context — the one with no parent — is
usually the browser window, represented by the Window object.

Warning: Because each browsing context is a complete document
environment, every <iframe> in a page requires increased memory and
other computing resources. While theoretically you can use as many
<iframe>s as you like, check for performance problems.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

allow

    Specifies a Permissions Policy for the <iframe>. The policy defines
    what features are available to the <iframe> (for example, access to
    the microphone, camera, battery, web-share, etc.) based on the
    origin of the request.

    Note: A Permissions Policy specified by the allow attribute
    implements a further restriction on top of the policy specified in
    the Permissions-Policy header. It doesn't replace it.

allowfullscreen

    Set to true if the <iframe> can activate fullscreen mode by calling
    the requestFullscreen() method.

    Note: This attribute is considered a legacy attribute and redefined
    as allow="fullscreen".

allowpaymentrequest Deprecated Non-standard

    Set to true if a cross-origin <iframe> should be allowed to invoke
    the Payment Request API.

    Note: This attribute is considered a legacy attribute and redefined
    as allow="payment".

credentialless Experimental Non-standard

    Set to true to make the <iframe> credentialless, meaning that its
    content will be loaded in a new, ephemeral context. It doesn't have
    access to the network, cookies, and storage data associated with its
    origin. It uses a new context local to the top-level document
    lifetime. In return, the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP)
    embedding rules can be lifted, so documents with COEP set can embed
    third-party documents that do not. See IFrame credentialless for
    more details.

csp Experimental

    A Content Security Policy enforced for the embedded resource. See
    HTMLIFrameElement.csp for details.

height

    The height of the frame in CSS pixels. Default is 150.

loading

    Indicates when the browser should load the iframe:

    eager

        Load the iframe immediately on page load (this is the default
        value).

    lazy

        Defer loading of the iframe until it reaches a calculated
        distance from the visual viewport, as defined by the browser.
        The intent is to avoid using the network and storage bandwidth
        required to fetch the frame until the browser is reasonably
        certain that it will be needed. This improves the performance
        and cost in most typical use cases, in particular by reducing
        initial page load times.

        Note: Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled. This
        is an anti-tracking measure.

name

    A targetable name for the embedded browsing context. This can be
    used in the target attribute of the <a>, <form>, or <base> elements;
    the formtarget attribute of the <input> or <button> elements; or the
    windowName parameter in the window.open() method.

referrerpolicy

    Indicates which referrer to send when fetching the frame's resource:

    no-referrer

        The Referer header will not be sent.

    no-referrer-when-downgrade

        The Referer header will not be sent to origins without TLS
        (HTTPS).

    origin

        The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the referring
        page: its scheme, host, and port.

    origin-when-cross-origin

        The referrer sent to other origins will be limited to the
        scheme, the host, and the port. Navigations on the same origin
        will still include the path.

    same-origin

        A referrer will be sent for same origin, but cross-origin
        requests will contain no referrer information.

    strict-origin

        Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the
        protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't
        send it to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).

    strict-origin-when-cross-origin (default)

        Send a full URL when performing a same-origin request, only send
        the origin when the protocol security level stays the same
        (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination
        (HTTPS→HTTP).

    unsafe-url

        The referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the
        fragment, password, or username). This value is unsafe, because
        it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected resources to
        insecure origins.

sandbox

    Controls the restrictions applied to the content embedded in the
    <iframe>. The value of the attribute can either be empty to apply
    all restrictions, or space-separated tokens to lift particular
    restrictions:

    allow-downloads

        Allows downloading files through an <a> or <area> element with
        the download attribute, as well as through the navigation that
        leads to a download of a file. This works regardless of whether
        the user clicked on the link, or JS code initiated it without
        user interaction.

    allow-downloads-without-user-activation Experimental

        Allows for downloads to occur without a gesture from the user.

    allow-forms

        Allows the page to submit forms. If this keyword is not used,
        form will be displayed as normal, but submitting it will not
        trigger input validation, sending data to a web server or
        closing a dialog.

    allow-modals

        Allows the page to open modal windows by Window.alert(),
        Window.confirm(), Window.print() and Window.prompt(), while
        opening a <dialog> is allowed regardless of this keyword. It
        also allows the page to receive BeforeUnloadEvent event.

    allow-orientation-lock

        Lets the resource lock the screen orientation.

    allow-pointer-lock

        Allows the page to use the Pointer Lock API.

    allow-popups

        Allows popups (like from Window.open(), target="_blank",
        Window.showModalDialog()). If this keyword is not used, that
        functionality will silently fail.

    allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox

        Allows a sandboxed document to open a new browsing context
        without forcing the sandboxing flags upon it. This will allow,
        for example, a third-party advertisement to be safely sandboxed
        without forcing the same restrictions upon the page the ad links
        to. If this flag is not included, a redirected page, popup
        window, or new tab will be subject to the same sandbox
        restrictions as the originating <iframe>.

    allow-presentation

        Allows embedders to have control over whether an iframe can
        start a presentation session.

    allow-same-origin

        If this token is not used, the resource is treated as being from
        a special origin that always fails the same-origin policy
        (potentially preventing access to data storage/cookies and some
        JavaScript APIs).

    allow-scripts

        Allows the page to run scripts (but not create pop-up windows).
        If this keyword is not used, this operation is not allowed.

    allow-storage-access-by-user-activation Experimental

        Allows a document loaded in the <iframe> to use the Storage
        Access API to request access to unpartitioned cookies.

    allow-top-navigation

        Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context (the
        one named _top).

    allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation

        Lets the resource navigate the top-level browsing context, but
        only if initiated by a user gesture.

    allow-top-navigation-to-custom-protocols

        Allows navigations to non-http protocols built into browser or
        registered by a website. This feature is also activated by
        allow-popups or allow-top-navigation keyword.

    Note:

    -   When the embedded document has the same origin as the embedding
        page, it is strongly discouraged to use both allow-scripts and
        allow-same-origin, as that lets the embedded document remove the
        sandbox attribute — making it no more secure than not using the
        sandbox attribute at all.
    -   Sandboxing is useless if the attacker can display content
        outside a sandboxed iframe — such as if the viewer opens the
        frame in a new tab. Such content should be also served from a
        separate origin to limit potential damage.

    Note: When redirecting the user, opening a popup window, or opening
    a new tab from an embedded page within an <iframe> with the sandbox
    attribute, the new browsing context is subject to the same sandbox
    restrictions. This can create issues — for example, if a page
    embedded within an <iframe> without a sandbox="allow-forms" or
    sandbox="allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox" attribute set on it opens a
    new site in a separate tab, form submission in that new browsing
    context will silently fail.

src

    The URL of the page to embed. Use a value of about:blank to embed an
    empty page that conforms to the same-origin policy. Also note that
    programmatically removing an <iframe>'s src attribute (e.g. via
    Element.removeAttribute()) causes about:blank to be loaded in the
    frame in Firefox (from version 65), Chromium-based browsers, and
    Safari/iOS.

srcdoc

    Inline HTML to embed, overriding the src attribute. If a browser
    does not support the srcdoc attribute, it will fall back to the URL
    in the src attribute.

width

    The width of the frame in CSS pixels. Default is 300.

Deprecated attributes

These attributes are deprecated and may no longer be supported by all
user agents. You should not use them in new content, and try to remove
them from existing content.

align Deprecated

    The alignment of this element with respect to the surrounding
    context.

frameborder Deprecated

    The value 1 (the default) draws a border around this frame. The
    value 0 removes the border around this frame, but you should instead
    use the CSS property border to control <iframe> borders.

longdesc Deprecated

    A URL of a long description of the frame's content. Due to
    widespread misuse, this is not helpful for non-visual browsers.

marginheight Deprecated

    The amount of space in pixels between the frame's content and its
    top and bottom borders.

marginwidth Deprecated

    The amount of space in pixels between the frame's content and its
    left and right borders.

scrolling Deprecated

    Indicates when the browser should provide a scrollbar for the frame:

    auto

        Only when the frame's content is larger than its dimensions.

    yes

        Always show a scrollbar.

    no

        Never show a scrollbar.

Scripting

Inline frames, like <frame> elements, are included in the window.frames
pseudo-array.

With the DOM HTMLIFrameElement object, scripts can access the window
object of the framed resource via the contentWindow property. The
contentDocument property refers to the document inside the <iframe>,
same as contentWindow.document.

From the inside of a frame, a script can get a reference to its parent
window with window.parent.

Script access to a frame's content is subject to the same-origin policy.
Scripts cannot access most properties in other window objects if the
script was loaded from a different origin, including scripts inside a
frame accessing the frame's parent. Cross-origin communication can be
achieved using Window.postMessage().

Positioning and scaling

As a replaced element, the position, alignment, and scaling of the
embedded document within the <iframe> element's box, can be adjusted
with the object-position and object-fit properties.

error and load event behavior

The error and load events fired on <iframe>s could be used to probe the
URL space of the local network's HTTP servers. Therefore, as a security
precaution user agents do not fire the error event on <iframe>s, and the
load event is always triggered even if the <iframe> content fails to
load.

Examples

A simple <iframe>

This example embeds the page at https://example.org in an iframe.

HTML

html

    <iframe
      src="https://example.org"
      title="iframe Example 1"
      width="400"
      height="300">
    </iframe>

Result

Accessibility concerns

People navigating with assistive technology such as a screen reader can
use the title attribute on an <iframe> to label its content. The title's
value should concisely describe the embedded content:

html

    <iframe
      title="Wikipedia page for Avocados"
      src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado"></iframe>

Without this title, they have to navigate into the <iframe> to determine
what its embedded content is. This context shift can be confusing and
time-consuming, especially for pages with multiple <iframe>s and/or if
embeds contain interactive content like video or audio.

# <i>: The Idiomatic Text element#

The <i> HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the
normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms,
taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been
presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i>
naming of this element.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

-   Use the <i> element for text that is set off from the normal prose
    for readability reasons. This would be a range of text with
    different semantic meaning than the surrounding text. Among the use
    cases for the <i> element are spans of text representing a different
    quality or mode of text, such as:
    -   Alternative voice or mood
    -   Taxonomic designations (such as the genus and species "Homo
        sapiens")
    -   Idiomatic terms from another language (such as "et cetera");
        these should include the lang attribute to identify the language
    -   Technical terms
    -   Transliterations
    -   Thoughts (such as "She wondered, What is this writer talking
        about, anyway?")
    -   Ship or vessel names in Western writing systems (such as "They
        searched the docks for the Empress of the Galaxy, the ship to
        which they were assigned.")
-   In earlier versions of the HTML specification, the <i> element was
    merely a presentational element used to display text in italics,
    much like the <b> element was used to display text in bold letters.
    This is no longer true, as these tags now define semantics rather
    than typographic appearance. A browser will typically still display
    the contents of the <i> element in italic type, but is, by
    definition, no longer required to do so. To display text in italic
    type, authors should use the CSS font-style property.
-   Be sure the text in question is not actually more appropriately
    marked up with another element.
    -   Use <em> to indicate stress emphasis.
    -   Use <strong> to indicate importance, seriousness, or urgency.
    -   Use <mark> to indicate relevance.
    -   Use <cite> to mark up the name of a work, such as a book, play,
        or song.
    -   Use <dfn> to mark up the defining instance of a term.

Examples

This example demonstrates using the <i> element to mark text that is in
another language.

      The Latin phrase <i lang="la">Veni, vidi, vici</i> is often mentioned in
      music, art, and literature.

# <image>: The Image element#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

Non-standard: This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards
track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not
work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between
implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

The <image> HTML element is an ancient and poorly supported precursor to
the <img> element. It should not be used.

Some browsers will attempt to automatically convert this into an <img>
element, and may succeed if the src attribute is specified as well.

Specifications

This does not appear to have been part of any formal specification. It
was mentioned in HTML+ Discussion Document - Dave Raggett, November 8,
1993 (Section 5.9 - Images), but was not part of the first revision of
HyperText Markup Language Specification - 2.0 in 1994.

%html-content%

The above example shows usage of the <img> element:

-   The src attribute is required, and contains the path to the image
    you want to embed.
-   The alt attribute holds a textual replacement for the image, which
    is mandatory and incredibly useful for accessibility — screen
    readers read the attribute value out to their users so they know
    what the image means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the
    image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors,
    content blocking, or linkrot.

There are many other attributes to achieve various purposes:

-   Referrer/CORS control for security and privacy: see crossorigin and
    referrerpolicy.
-   Use both width and height to set the intrinsic size of the image,
    allowing it to take up space before it loads, to mitigate content
    layout shifts.
-   Responsive image hints with sizes and srcset (see also the <picture>
    element and our Responsive images tutorial).

Supported image formats

The HTML standard doesn't list what image formats to support, so user
agents may support different formats.

Note: The Image file type and format guide provides comprehensive
information about image formats and their web browser support. This
section is just a summary!

The image file formats that are most commonly used on the web are:

-   APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) — Good choice for lossless
    animation sequences (GIF is less performant)
-   AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) — Good choice for both images and
    animated images due to high performance.
-   GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) — Good choice for simple images
    and animations.
-   JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group image) — Good choice for lossy
    compression of still images (currently the most popular).
-   PNG (Portable Network Graphics) — Good choice for lossless
    compression of still images (slightly better quality than JPEG).
-   SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) — Vector image format. Use for images
    that must be drawn accurately at different sizes.
-   WebP (Web Picture format) — Excellent choice for both images and
    animated images

Formats like WebP and AVIF are recommended as they perform much better
than PNG, JPEG, GIF for both still and animated images.

SVG remains the recommended format for images that must be drawn
accurately at different sizes.

Image loading errors

If an error occurs while loading or rendering an image, and an onerror
event handler has been set for the error event, that event handler will
get called. This can happen in several situations, including:

-   The src attribute is empty ("") or null.
-   The src URL is the same as the URL of the page the user is currently
    on.
-   The image is corrupted in some way that prevents it from being
    loaded.
-   The image's metadata is corrupted in such a way that it's impossible
    to retrieve its dimensions, and no dimensions were specified in the
    <img> element's attributes.
-   The image is in a format not supported by the user agent.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

alt

    Defines text that can replace the image in the page.

    Note: Browsers do not always display images. There are a number of
    situations in which a browser might not display images, such as:

    -   Non-visual browsers (such as those used by people with visual
        impairments)
    -   The user chooses not to display images (saving bandwidth,
        privacy reasons)
    -   The image is invalid or an unsupported type

    In these cases, the browser may replace the image with the text in
    the element's alt attribute. For these reasons and others, provide a
    useful value for alt whenever possible.

    Setting this attribute to an empty string (alt="") indicates that
    this image is not a key part of the content (it's decoration or a
    tracking pixel), and that non-visual browsers may omit it from
    rendering. Visual browsers will also hide the broken image icon if
    the alt attribute is empty and the image failed to display.

    This attribute is also used when copying and pasting the image to
    text, or saving a linked image to a bookmark.

crossorigin

    Indicates if the fetching of the image must be done using a CORS
    request. Image data from a CORS-enabled image returned from a CORS
    request can be reused in the <canvas> element without being marked
    "tainted".

    If the crossorigin attribute is not specified, then a non-CORS
    request is sent (without the Origin request header), and the browser
    marks the image as tainted and restricts access to its image data,
    preventing its usage in <canvas> elements.

    If the crossorigin attribute is specified, then a CORS request is
    sent (with the Origin request header); but if the server does not
    opt into allowing cross-origin access to the image data by the
    origin site (by not sending any Access-Control-Allow-Origin response
    header, or by not including the site's origin in any
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header it does send), then the
    browser blocks the image from loading, and logs a CORS error to the
    devtools console.

    Allowed values:

    anonymous

        A CORS request is sent with credentials omitted (that is, no
        cookies, X.509 certificates, or Authorization request header).

    use-credentials

        The CORS request is sent with any credentials included (that is,
        cookies, X.509 certificates, and the Authorization request
        header). If the server does not opt into sharing credentials
        with the origin site (by sending back the
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true response header), then
        the browser marks the image as tainted and restricts access to
        its image data.

    If the attribute has an invalid value, browsers handle it as if the
    anonymous value was used. See CORS settings attributes for
    additional information.

decoding

    This attribute provides a hint to the browser as to whether it
    should perform image decoding along with rendering the other DOM
    content in a single presentation step that looks more "correct"
    (sync), or render and present the other DOM content first and then
    decode the image and present it later (async). In practice, async
    means that the next paint does not wait for the image to decode.

    It is often difficult to perceive any noticeable effect when using
    decoding on static <img> elements. They'll likely be initially
    rendered as empty images while the image files are fetched (either
    from the network or from the cache) and then handled independently
    anyway, so the "syncing" of content updates is less apparent.
    However, the blocking of rendering while decoding happens, while
    often quite small, can be measured — even if it is difficult to
    observe with the human eye. See What does the image decoding
    attribute actually do? for a more detailed analysis (tunetheweb.com,
    2023).

    Using different decoding types can result in more noticeable
    differences when dynamically inserting <img> elements into the DOM
    via JavaScript — see HTMLImageElement.decoding for more details.

    Allowed values:

    sync

        Decode the image synchronously along with rendering the other
        DOM content, and present everything together.

    async

        Decode the image asynchronously, after rendering and presenting
        the other DOM content.

    auto

        No preference for the decoding mode; the browser decides what is
        best for the user. This is the default value.

elementtiming

    Marks the image for observation by the PerformanceElementTiming API.
    The value given becomes an identifier for the observed image
    element. See also the elementtiming attribute page.

fetchpriority

    Provides a hint of the relative priority to use when fetching the
    image. Allowed values:

    high

        Signals a high-priority fetch relative to other images.

    low

        Signals a low-priority fetch relative to other images.

    auto

        Default: Signals automatic determination of fetch priority
        relative to other images.

height

    The intrinsic height of the image, in pixels. Must be an integer
    without a unit.

    Note: Including height and width enables the aspect ratio of the
    image to be calculated by the browser prior to the image being
    loaded. This aspect ratio is used to reserve the space needed to
    display the image, reducing or even preventing a layout shift when
    the image is downloaded and painted to the screen. Reducing layout
    shift is a major component of good user experience and web
    performance.

ismap

    This Boolean attribute indicates that the image is part of a
    server-side map. If so, the coordinates where the user clicked on
    the image are sent to the server.

    Note: This attribute is allowed only if the <img> element is a
    descendant of an <a> element with a valid href attribute. This gives
    users without pointing devices a fallback destination.

loading

    Indicates how the browser should load the image:

    eager

        Loads the image immediately, regardless of whether or not the
        image is currently within the visible viewport (this is the
        default value).

    lazy

        Defers loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance
        from the viewport, as defined by the browser. The intent is to
        avoid the network and storage bandwidth needed to handle the
        image until it's reasonably certain that it will be needed. This
        generally improves the performance of the content in most
        typical use cases.

    Note: Loading is only deferred when JavaScript is enabled. This is
    an anti-tracking measure, because if a user agent supported lazy
    loading when scripting is disabled, it would still be possible for a
    site to track a user's approximate scroll position throughout a
    session, by strategically placing images in a page's markup such
    that a server can track how many images are requested and when.
    Note: Images with loading set to lazy will never be loaded if they
    do not intersect a visible part of an element, even if loading them
    would change that as unloaded images have a width and height of 0.
    Putting width and height on lazyloaded images fixes this issue and
    is a best practice, recommended by the specification. Doing so also
    helps prevent layout shifts.

referrerpolicy

    A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the
    resource:

    -   no-referrer: The Referer header will not be sent.
    -   no-referrer-when-downgrade: The Referer header will not be sent
        to origins without TLS (HTTPS).
    -   origin: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the
        referring page: its scheme, host, and port.
    -   origin-when-cross-origin: The referrer sent to other origins
        will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port.
        Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
    -   same-origin: A referrer will be sent for same origin, but
        cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
    -   strict-origin: Only send the origin of the document as the
        referrer when the protocol security level stays the same
        (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination
        (HTTPS→HTTP).
    -   strict-origin-when-cross-origin (default): Send a full URL when
        performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the
        protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send
        no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
    -   unsafe-url: The referrer will include the origin and the path
        (but not the fragment, password, or username). This value is
        unsafe, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected
        resources to insecure origins.

sizes

    One or more strings separated by commas, indicating a set of source
    sizes. Each source size consists of:

    1.  A media condition. This must be omitted for the last item in the
        list.
    2.  A source size value.

    Media Conditions describe properties of the viewport, not of the
    image. For example, (max-height: 500px) 1000px proposes to use a
    source of 1000px width, if the viewport is not higher than 500px.

    Source size values specify the intended display size of the image.
    User agents use the current source size to select one of the sources
    supplied by the srcset attribute, when those sources are described
    using width (w) descriptors. The selected source size affects the
    intrinsic size of the image (the image's display size if no CSS
    styling is applied). If the srcset attribute is absent, or contains
    no values with a width descriptor, then the sizes attribute has no
    effect.

src

    The image URL. Mandatory for the <img> element. On browsers
    supporting srcset, src is treated like a candidate image with a
    pixel density descriptor 1x, unless an image with this pixel density
    descriptor is already defined in srcset, or unless srcset contains w
    descriptors.

srcset

    One or more strings separated by commas, indicating possible image
    sources for the user agent to use. Each string is composed of:

    1.  A URL to an image
    2.  Optionally, whitespace followed by one of:
        -   A width descriptor (a positive integer directly followed by
            w). The width descriptor is divided by the source size given
            in the sizes attribute to calculate the effective pixel
            density.
        -   A pixel density descriptor (a positive floating point number
            directly followed by x).

    If no descriptor is specified, the source is assigned the default
    descriptor of 1x.

    It is incorrect to mix width descriptors and pixel density
    descriptors in the same srcset attribute. Duplicate descriptors (for
    instance, two sources in the same srcset which are both described
    with 2x) are also invalid.

    If the srcset attribute uses width descriptors, the sizes attribute
    must also be present, or the srcset itself will be ignored.

    The user agent selects any of the available sources at its
    discretion. This provides them with significant leeway to tailor
    their selection based on things like user preferences or bandwidth
    conditions. See our Responsive images tutorial for an example.

width

    The intrinsic width of the image in pixels. Must be an integer
    without a unit.

usemap

    The partial URL (starting with #) of an image map associated with
    the element.

    Note: You cannot use this attribute if the <img> element is inside
    an <a> or <button> element.

Deprecated attributes

align Deprecated

    Aligns the image with its surrounding context. Use the float and/or
    vertical-align CSS properties instead of this attribute. Allowed
    values:

    top

        Equivalent to vertical-align: top or vertical-align: text-top

    middle

        Equivalent to vertical-align: -moz-middle-with-baseline

    bottom

        The default, equivalent to vertical-align: unset or
        vertical-align: initial

    left

        Equivalent to float: left

    right

        Equivalent to float: right

border Deprecated

    The width of a border around the image. Use the border CSS property
    instead.

hspace Deprecated

    The number of pixels of white space on the left and right of the
    image. Use the margin CSS property instead.

longdesc Deprecated

    A link to a more detailed description of the image. Possible values
    are a URL or an element id.

    Note: This attribute is mentioned in the latest W3C version, HTML
    5.2, but has been removed from the WHATWG's HTML Living Standard. It
    has an uncertain future; authors should use a WAI-ARIA alternative
    such as aria-describedby or aria-details.

name Deprecated

    A name for the element. Use the id attribute instead.

vspace Deprecated

    The number of pixels of white space above and below the image. Use
    the margin CSS property instead.

Styling with CSS

<img> is a replaced element; it has a display value of inline by
default, but its default dimensions are defined by the embedded image's
intrinsic values, like it were inline-block. You can set properties like
border/border-radius, padding/margin, width, height, etc. on an image.

<img> has no baseline, so when images are used in an inline formatting
context with vertical-align: baseline, the bottom of the image will be
placed on the text baseline.

You can use the object-position property to position the image within
the element's box, and the object-fit property to adjust the sizing of
the image within the box (for example, whether the image should fit the
box or fill it even if clipping is required).

Depending on its type, an image may have an intrinsic width and height.
For some image types, however, intrinsic dimensions are unnecessary. SVG
images, for instance, have no intrinsic dimensions if their root <svg>
element doesn't have a width or height set on it.

Examples

Alternative text

The following example embeds an image into the page and includes
alternative text for accessibility.

html

    <img src="favicon144.png" alt="MDN" />

Image link

This example builds upon the previous one, showing how to turn the image
into a link. To do so, nest the <img> tag inside the <a>. You should
make the alternative text describe the resource the link is pointing to,
as if you were using a text link instead.

html

    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">
      <img src="favicon144.png" alt="Visit the MDN site" />
    </a>

Using the srcset attribute

In this example we include a srcset attribute with a reference to a
high-resolution version of the logo; this will be loaded instead of the
src image on high-resolution devices. The image referenced in the src
attribute is counted as a 1x candidate in user agents that support
srcset.

html

    <img src="favicon72.png" alt="MDN" srcset="favicon144.png 2x" />

Using the srcset and sizes attributes

The src attribute is ignored in user agents that support srcset when w
descriptors are included. When the (max-width: 600px) media condition
matches, the 200 pixel-wide image will load (it is the one that matches
200px most closely), otherwise the other image will load.

html

    <img
      src="clock-demo-200px.png"
      alt="The time is 12:45."
      srcset="clock-demo-200px.png 200w, clock-demo-400px.png 400w"
      sizes="(max-width: 600px) 200px, 50vw" />

Note: To see the resizing in action, view the example on a separate
page, so you can actually resize the content area.

Security and privacy concerns

Although <img> elements have innocent uses, they can have undesirable
consequences for user security and privacy. See Referer header: privacy
and security concerns for more information and mitigations.

Accessibility concerns

Authoring meaningful alternate descriptions

An alt attribute's value should provide a clear and concise text
replacement for the image's content. It should not describe the presence
of the image itself or the file name of the image. If the alt attribute
is purposefully left off because the image has no textual equivalent,
consider alternate methods to present what the image is trying to
communicate.

Don't

html

    <img alt="image" src="penguin.jpg" />

Do

html

    <img alt="A Rockhopper Penguin is standing on a beach." src="penguin.jpg" />

When an alt attribute is not present on an image, some screen readers
may announce the image's file name instead. This can be a confusing
experience if the file name isn't representative of the image's
contents.

-   Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.0

Identifying SVG as an image

Due to a VoiceOver bug, VoiceOver does not correctly announce SVG images
as images. Include role="img" to all <img> elements with SVG source
files to ensure assistive technologies correctly announce the SVG as
image content.

html

    <img src="mdn.svg" alt="MDN" role="img" />

The title attribute

The title attribute is not an acceptable substitute for the alt
attribute. Additionally, avoid duplicating the alt attribute's value in
a title attribute declared on the same image. Doing so may cause some
screen readers to announce the same text twice, creating a confusing
experience.

The title attribute should also not be used as supplemental captioning
information to accompany an image's alt description. If an image needs a
caption, use the figure and figcaption elements.

The value of the title attribute is usually presented to the user as a
tooltip, which appears shortly after the cursor stops moving over the
image. While this can provide additional information to the user, you
should not assume that the user will ever see it: the user may only have
keyboard or touchscreen. If you have information that's particularly
important or valuable for the user, present it inline using one of the
methods mentioned above instead of using title.

# <input type="button">#

<input> elements of type button are rendered as simple push buttons,
which can be programmed to control custom functionality anywhere on a
webpage as required when assigned an event handler function (typically
for the click event).

%html-content%

Note: While <input> elements of type button are still perfectly valid
HTML, the newer <button> element is now the favored way to create
buttons. Given that a <button>'s label text is inserted between the
opening and closing tags, you can include HTML in the label, even
images.

Value

Button with a value

An <input type="button"> elements' value attribute contains a string
that is used as the button's label. The value provides the accessible
description for the button.

html

    <input type="button" value="Click Me" />

Button without a value

If you don't specify a value, you get an empty button:

html

    <input type="button" />

Using buttons

<input type="button"> elements have no default behavior (their cousins,
<input type="submit"> and <input type="reset"> are used to submit and
reset forms, respectively). To make buttons do anything, you have to
write JavaScript code to do the work.

A simple button

We'll begin by creating a simple button with a click event handler that
starts our machine (well, it toggles the value of the button and the
text content of the following paragraph):

html

    <form>
      <input type="button" value="Start machine" />
    </form>
    <p>The machine is stopped.</p>

js

    const button = document.querySelector("input");
    const paragraph = document.querySelector("p");

    button.addEventListener("click", updateButton);

    function updateButton() {
      if (button.value === "Start machine") {
        button.value = "Stop machine";
        paragraph.textContent = "The machine has started!";
      } else {
        button.value = "Start machine";
        paragraph.textContent = "The machine is stopped.";
      }
    }

The script gets a reference to the HTMLInputElement object representing
the <input> in the DOM, saving this reference in the variable button.
addEventListener() is then used to establish a function that will be run
when click events occur on the button.

Adding keyboard shortcuts to buttons

Keyboard shortcuts, also known as access keys and keyboard equivalents,
let the user trigger a button using a key or combination of keys on the
keyboard. To add a keyboard shortcut to a button — just as you would
with any <input> for which it makes sense — you use the accesskey global
attribute.

In this example, s is specified as the access key (you'll need to press
s plus the particular modifier keys for your browser/OS combination; see
accesskey for a useful list of those).

html

    <form>
      <input type="button" value="Start machine" accesskey="s" />
    </form>
    <p>The machine is stopped.</p>

    const button = document.querySelector("input");
    const paragraph = document.querySelector("p");

    button.addEventListener("click", updateButton);

    function updateButton() {
      if (button.value === "Start machine") {
        button.value = "Stop machine";
        paragraph.textContent = "The machine has started!";
      } else {
        button.value = "Start machine";
        paragraph.textContent = "The machine is stopped.";
      }
    }

Note: The problem with the above example of course is that the user will
not know what the access key is! In a real site, you'd have to provide
this information in a way that doesn't interfere with the site design
(for example by providing an easily accessible link that points to
information on what the site accesskeys are).

Disabling and enabling a button

To disable a button, specify the disabled global attribute on it, like
so:

html

    <input type="button" value="Disable me" disabled />

Setting the disabled attribute

You can enable and disable buttons at run time by setting disabled to
true or false. In this example our button starts off enabled, but if you
press it, it is disabled using button.disabled = true. A setTimeout()
function is then used to reset the button back to its enabled state
after two seconds.

html

    <input type="button" value="Enabled" />

js

    const button = document.querySelector("input");

    button.addEventListener("click", disableButton);

    function disableButton() {
      button.disabled = true;
      button.value = "Disabled";
      setTimeout(() => {
        button.disabled = false;
        button.value = "Enabled";
      }, 2000);
    }

Inheriting the disabled state

If the disabled attribute isn't specified, the button inherits its
disabled state from its parent element. This makes it possible to enable
and disable groups of elements all at once by enclosing them in a
container such as a <fieldset> element, and then setting disabled on the
container.

The example below shows this in action. This is very similar to the
previous example, except that the disabled attribute is set on the
<fieldset> when the first button is pressed — this causes all three
buttons to be disabled until the two second timeout has passed.

html

    <fieldset>
      <legend>Button group</legend>
      <input type="button" value="Button 1" />
      <input type="button" value="Button 2" />
      <input type="button" value="Button 3" />
    </fieldset>

js

    const button = document.querySelector("input");
    const fieldset = document.querySelector("fieldset");

    button.addEventListener("click", disableButton);

    function disableButton() {
      fieldset.disabled = true;
      setTimeout(() => {
        fieldset.disabled = false;
      }, 2000);
    }

Note: Firefox will, unlike other browsers, by default, persist the
dynamic disabled state of a <button> across page loads. Use the
autocomplete attribute to control this feature.

Validation

Buttons don't participate in constraint validation; they have no real
value to be constrained.

Examples

The below example shows a very simple drawing app created using a
<canvas> element and some simple CSS and JavaScript (we'll hide the CSS
for brevity). The top two controls allow you to choose the color and
size of the drawing pen. The button, when clicked, invokes a function
that clears the canvas.

html

    <div class="toolbar">
      <input type="color" aria-label="select pen color" />
      <input
        type="range"
        min="2"
        max="50"
        value="30"
        aria-label="select pen size" /><span class="output">30</span>
      <input type="button" value="Clear canvas" />
    </div>

    <canvas class="myCanvas">
      <p>Add suitable fallback here.</p>
    </canvas>

    body {
      background: #ccc;
      margin: 0;
      overflow: hidden;
    }

    .toolbar {
      background: #ccc;
      width: 150px;
      height: 75px;
      padding: 5px;
    }

    input[type="color"],
    input[type="button"] {
      width: 90%;
      margin: 0 auto;
      display: block;
    }

    input[type="range"] {
      width: 70%;
    }

    span {
      position: relative;
      bottom: 5px;
    }

js

    const canvas = document.querySelector(".myCanvas");
    const width = (canvas.width = window.innerWidth);
    const height = (canvas.height = window.innerHeight - 85);
    const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

    ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(0 0 0)";
    ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);

    const colorPicker = document.querySelector('input[type="color"]');
    const sizePicker = document.querySelector('input[type="range"]');
    const output = document.querySelector(".output");
    const clearBtn = document.querySelector('input[type="button"]');

    // covert degrees to radians
    function degToRad(degrees) {
      return (degrees * Math.PI) / 180;
    }

    // update sizepicker output value

    sizePicker.oninput = () => {
      output.textContent = sizePicker.value;
    };

    // store mouse pointer coordinates, and whether the button is pressed
    let curX;
    let curY;
    let pressed = false;

    // update mouse pointer coordinates
    document.onmousemove = (e) => {
      curX = e.pageX;
      curY = e.pageY;
    };

    canvas.onmousedown = () => {
      pressed = true;
    };

    canvas.onmouseup = () => {
      pressed = false;
    };

    clearBtn.onclick = () => {
      ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(0 0 0)";
      ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);
    };

    function draw() {
      if (pressed) {
        ctx.fillStyle = colorPicker.value;
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(
          curX,
          curY - 85,
          sizePicker.value,
          degToRad(0),
          degToRad(360),
          false,
        );
        ctx.fill();
      }

      requestAnimationFrame(draw);
    }

# <input type="checkbox">#

<input> elements of type checkbox are rendered by default as boxes that
are checked (ticked) when activated, like you might see in an official
government paper form. The exact appearance depends upon the operating
system configuration under which the browser is running. Generally this
is a square but it may have rounded corners. A checkbox allows you to
select single values for submission in a form (or not).

Note: Radio buttons are similar to checkboxes, but with an important
distinction — same-named radio buttons are grouped into a set in which
only one radio button can be selected at a time, whereas checkboxes
allow you to turn single values on and off. Where multiple same-named
controls exist, radio buttons allow one to be selected out of them all,
whereas checkboxes allow multiple values to be selected.

Value

A string representing the value of the checkbox. This is not displayed
on the client-side, but on the server this is the value given to the
data submitted with the checkbox's name. Take the following example:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          id="subscribeNews"
          name="subscribe"
          value="newsletter" />
        <label for="subscribeNews">Subscribe to newsletter?</label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button type="submit">Subscribe</button>
      </div>
    </form>

In this example, we've got a name of subscribe, and a value of
newsletter. When the form is submitted, the data name/value pair will be
subscribe=newsletter.

If the value attribute was omitted, the default value for the checkbox
is on, so the submitted data in that case would be subscribe=on.

Note: If a checkbox is unchecked when its form is submitted, neither the
name nor the value is submitted to the server. There is no HTML-only
method of representing a checkbox's unchecked state (e.g.
value=unchecked). If you wanted to submit a default value for the
checkbox when it is unchecked, you could include JavaScript to create a
<input type="hidden"> within the form with a value indicating an
unchecked state.

Additional attributes

In addition to the common attributes shared by all <input> elements,
"checkbox" inputs support the following attributes.

checked

    A boolean attribute indicating whether this checkbox is checked by
    default (when the page loads). It does not indicate whether this
    checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox's state is changed,
    this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the
    HTMLInputElement's checked IDL attribute is updated.)

    Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkbox's value is only
    included in the submitted data if the checkbox is currently checked.
    If it is, then the value of the checkbox's value attribute is
    reported as the input's value, or on if no value is set. Unlike
    other browsers, Firefox by default persists the dynamic checked
    state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete
    attribute to control this feature.

value

    The value attribute is one which all <input>s share; however, it
    serves a special purpose for inputs of type checkbox: when a form is
    submitted, only checkboxes which are currently checked are submitted
    to the server, and the reported value is the value of the value
    attribute. If the value is not otherwise specified, it is the string
    on by default. This is demonstrated in the section Value above.

Using checkbox inputs

We already covered the most basic use of checkboxes above. Let's now
look at the other common checkbox-related features and techniques you'll
need.

Handling multiple checkboxes

The example we saw above only contained one checkbox; in real-world
situations you'll be likely to encounter multiple checkboxes. If they
are completely unrelated, then you can just deal with them all
separately, as shown above. However, if they're all related, things are
not quite so simple.

For example, in the following demo we include multiple checkboxes to
allow the user to select their interests (see the full version in the
Examples section).

html

    <fieldset>
      <legend>Choose your interests</legend>
      <div>
        <input type="checkbox" id="coding" name="interest" value="coding" />
        <label for="coding">Coding</label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="checkbox" id="music" name="interest" value="music" />
        <label for="music">Music</label>
      </div>
    </fieldset>

In this example you will see that we've given each checkbox the same
name. If both checkboxes are checked and then the form is submitted,
you'll get a string of name/value pairs submitted like this:
interest=coding&interest=music. When this string reaches the server, you
need to parse it other than as an associative array, so all values, not
only the last value, of interest are captured. For one technique used
with Python, see Handle Multiple Checkboxes with a Single Serverside
Variable, for example.

Checking boxes by default

To make a checkbox checked by default, you give it the checked
attribute. See the below example:

html

    <fieldset>
      <legend>Choose your interests</legend>
      <div>
        <input type="checkbox" id="coding" name="interest" value="coding" checked />
        <label for="coding">Coding</label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="checkbox" id="music" name="interest" value="music" />
        <label for="music">Music</label>
      </div>
    </fieldset>

Providing a bigger hit area for your checkboxes

In the above examples, you may have noticed that you can toggle a
checkbox by clicking on its associated <label> element as well as on the
checkbox itself. This is a really useful feature of HTML form labels
that makes it easier to click the option you want, especially on
small-screen devices like smartphones.

Beyond accessibility, this is another good reason to properly set up
<label> elements on your forms.

Indeterminate state checkboxes

In addition to the checked and unchecked states, there is a third state
a checkbox can be in: indeterminate. This is a state in which it's
impossible to say whether the item is toggled on or off. This is set
using the HTMLInputElement object's indeterminate property via
JavaScript (it cannot be set using an HTML attribute):

js

    inputInstance.indeterminate = true;

A checkbox in the indeterminate state has a horizontal line in the box
(it looks somewhat like a hyphen or minus sign) instead of a check/tick
in most browsers.

There are not many use cases for this property. The most common is when
a checkbox is available that "owns" a number of sub-options (which are
also checkboxes). If all of the sub-options are checked, the owning
checkbox is also checked, and if they're all unchecked, the owning
checkbox is unchecked. If any one or more of the sub-options have a
different state than the others, the owning checkbox is in the
indeterminate state.

This can be seen in the below example (thanks to CSS Tricks for the
inspiration). In this example we keep track of the ingredients we are
collecting for a recipe. When you check or uncheck an ingredient's
checkbox, a JavaScript function checks the total number of checked
ingredients:

-   If none are checked, the recipe name's checkbox is set to unchecked.
-   If one or two are checked, the recipe name's checkbox is set to
    indeterminate.
-   If all three are checked, the recipe name's checkbox is set to
    checked.

So in this case the indeterminate state is used to state that collecting
the ingredients has started, but the recipe is not yet complete.

js

    const overall = document.querySelector("#enchantment");
    const ingredients = document.querySelectorAll("ul input");

    overall.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
    });

    for (const ingredient of ingredients) {
      ingredient.addEventListener("click", updateDisplay);
    }

    function updateDisplay() {
      let checkedCount = 0;
      for (const ingredient of ingredients) {
        if (ingredient.checked) {
          checkedCount++;
        }
      }

      if (checkedCount === 0) {
        overall.checked = false;
        overall.indeterminate = false;
      } else if (checkedCount === ingredients.length) {
        overall.checked = true;
        overall.indeterminate = false;
      } else {
        overall.checked = false;
        overall.indeterminate = true;
      }
    }

Complete the recipe

Enchantment table

-   Book
-   Diamonds (x2)
-   Obsidian (x4)

Note: If you submit a form with an indeterminate checkbox, the same
thing happens as if the checkbox were unchecked — no data is submitted
to represent the checkbox.

Validation

Checkboxes do support validation (offered to all <input>s). However,
most of the ValidityStates will always be false. If the checkbox has the
required attribute, but is not checked, then ValidityState.valueMissing
will be true.

Examples

The following example is an extended version of the "multiple
checkboxes" example we saw above — it has more standard options, plus an
"other" checkbox that when checked causes a text field to appear to
enter a value for the "other" option. This is achieved with a simple
block of JavaScript. The example includes implicit labels, with the
<input> directly inside the <label>. The text input, without a visible
label, includes the aria-label attribute which provides its accessible
name. This example also includes some CSS to improve the styling.

# <input type="color">#

<input> elements of type color provide a user interface element that
lets a user specify a color, either by using a visual color picker
interface or by entering the color into a text field in #rrggbb
hexadecimal format.

Only simple colors (without alpha channel) are allowed though CSS colors
has more formats, e.g. color names, functional notations and a
hexadecimal format with an alpha channel.

The element's presentation may vary substantially from one browser
and/or platform to another—it might be a simple textual input that
automatically validates to ensure that the color information is entered
in the proper format, or a platform-standard color picker, or some kind
of custom color picker window.

Value

The value of an <input> element of type color is always a string which
contains a 7-character string specifying an RGB color in hexadecimal
format. While you can input the color in either upper- or lower-case, it
will be stored in lower-case form. The value is never in any other form,
and is never empty.

Note: Setting the value to anything that isn't a valid, fully-opaque,
RGB color in hexadecimal notation will result in the value being set to
#000000. In particular, you can't use CSS's standardized color names, or
any CSS function syntax, to set the value. This makes sense when you
keep in mind that HTML and CSS are separate languages and
specifications. In addition, colors with an alpha channel are not
supported; specifying a color in 9-character hexadecimal notation (e.g.
#009900aa) will also result in the color being set to #000000.

Using color inputs

Inputs of type color are simple, due to the limited number of attributes
they support.

Providing a default color

You can update the simple example above to set a default value, so that
the color picker is pre-filled with the default color and the color
picker (if any) will also default to that color:

html

    <input type="color" value="#ff0000" />

If you don't specify a value, the default is #000000, which is black.
The value must be in seven-character hexadecimal notation, meaning the
"#" character followed by two digits each representing red, green, and
blue, like this: #rrggbb. If you have colors that are in any other
format (such as CSS color names or CSS color functions such as rgb() or
hsl() ), you'll have to convert them to hexadecimal before setting the
value.

Tracking color changes

As is the case with other <input> types, there are two events that can
be used to detect changes to the color value: input and change. input is
fired on the <input> element every time the color changes. The change
event is fired when the user dismisses the color picker. In both cases,
you can determine the new value of the element by looking at its value.

Here's an example that watches changes over time to the color value:

js

    colorPicker.addEventListener("input", updateFirst, false);
    colorPicker.addEventListener("change", watchColorPicker, false);

    function watchColorPicker(event) {
      document.querySelectorAll("p").forEach((p) => {
        p.style.color = event.target.value;
      });
    }

Selecting the value

When a browser doesn't support a color picker interface, its
implementation of color inputs will be a text box that validates the
contents automatically to ensure that the value is in the correct
format. In this case you can use the select() method to select the text
currently in the edit field.

If the browser instead uses a color picker, select() does nothing. You
should be aware of this behavior so your code can respond appropriately
in either case.

js

    colorPicker.select();

Validation

A color input's value is considered to be invalid if the user agent is
unable to convert the user's input into seven-character lower-case
hexadecimal notation. If and when this is the case, the :invalid
pseudo-class is applied to the element.

Example

Let's create an example which does a little more with the color input by
tracking the change and input events to take the new color and apply it
to every <p> element in the document.

HTML

The HTML is fairly straightforward — a couple of paragraphs of
descriptive material with an <input> of type color with the ID
color-picker, which we'll use to change the color of the paragraphs'
text.

html

    <p>
      An example demonstrating the use of the
      <code>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code> control.
    </p>

    <label for="color-picker">Color:</label>
    <input type="color" value="#ff0000" id="color-picker" />

    <p>
      Watch the paragraph colors change when you adjust the color picker. As you
      make changes in the color picker, the first paragraph's color changes, as a
      preview (this uses the <code>input</code> event). When you close the color
      picker, the <code>change</code> event fires, and we detect that to change
      every paragraph to the selected color.
    </p>

JavaScript

First, there's some setup. Here we establish some variables, setting up
a variable that contains the color we'll set the color picker to when we
first load up, and then setting up a load handler to do the main startup
work once the page is fully loaded.

js

    let colorPicker;
    const defaultColor = "#0000ff";

    window.addEventListener("load", startup, false);

Initialization

Once the page is loaded, our load event handler, startup(), is called:

js

    function startup() {
      colorPicker = document.querySelector("#color-picker");
      colorPicker.value = defaultColor;
      colorPicker.addEventListener("input", updateFirst, false);
      colorPicker.addEventListener("change", updateAll, false);
      colorPicker.select();
    }

This gets a reference to the color <input> element in a variable called
colorPicker, then sets the color input's value to the value in
defaultColor. Then the color input's input event is set up to call our
updateFirst() function, and the change event is set to call updateAll().
These are both seen below.

Finally, we call select() to select the text content of the color input
if the control is implemented as a text field (this has no effect if a
color picker interface is provided instead).

Reacting to color changes

We provide two functions that deal with color changes. The updateFirst()
function is called in response to the input event. It changes the color
of the first paragraph element in the document to match the new value of
the color input. Since input events are fired every time an adjustment
is made to the value (for example, if the brightness of the color is
increased), these will happen repeatedly as the color picker is used.

js

    function updateFirst(event) {
      const p = document.querySelector("p");
      if (p) {
        p.style.color = event.target.value;
      }
    }

When the color picker is dismissed, indicating that the value will not
change again (unless the user re-opens the color picker), a change event
is sent to the element. We handle that event using the updateAll()
function, using Event.target.value to obtain the final selected color:

js

    function updateAll(event) {
      document.querySelectorAll("p").forEach((p) => {
        p.style.color = event.target.value;
      });
    }

This sets the color of every <p> block so that its color attribute
matches the current value of the color input, which is referred to using
event.target.

Result

The final result looks like this:

# <input type="date">#

<input> elements of type="date" create input fields that let the user
enter a date, either with a textbox that validates the input or a
special date picker interface.

The resulting value includes the year, month, and day, but not the time.
The time and datetime-local input types support time and date+time
input.

%html-content%

The input UI generally varies from browser to browser; see Browser
compatibility for further details. In unsupported browsers, the control
degrades gracefully to <input type="text">.

Value

A string representing the date entered in the input. The date is
formatted according to Date strings format.

You can set a default value for the input with a date inside the value
attribute, like so:

html

    <input type="date" value="2017-06-01" />

Note: The displayed date format will differ from the actual value — the
displayed date is formatted based on the locale of the user's browser,
but the parsed value is always formatted yyyy-mm-dd.

You can get and set the date value in JavaScript with the
HTMLInputElement value and valueAsNumber properties. For example:

js

    const dateControl = document.querySelector('input[type="date"]');
    dateControl.value = "2017-06-01";
    console.log(dateControl.value); // prints "2017-06-01"
    console.log(dateControl.valueAsNumber); // prints 1496275200000, a JavaScript timestamp (ms)

This code finds the first <input> element whose type is date, and sets
its value to 2017-06-01 (June 1st, 2017). It then reads that value back
in string and number formats.

Additional attributes

The attributes common to all <input> elements apply to the date inputs
as well, but might not influence its presentation. For example size and
placeholder might not work. date inputs have the following additional
attributes.

max

The latest date to accept. If the value entered into the element occurs
afterward, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the
max attribute isn't a possible date string in the format yyyy-mm-dd,
then the element has no maximum date value.

If both the max and min attributes are set, this value must be a date
string later than or equal to the one in the min attribute.

min

The earliest date to accept. If the value entered into the element
occurs beforehand, the element fails constraint validation. If the value
of the min attribute isn't a possible date string in the format
yyyy-mm-dd, then the element has no minimum date value.

If both the max and min attributes are set, this value must be a date
string earlier than or equal to the one in the max attribute.

step

The step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the
value must adhere to, or the special value any, which is described
below. Only values which are equal to the basis for stepping (min if
specified, value otherwise, and an appropriate default value if neither
of those is provided) are valid.

A string value of any means that no stepping is implied, and any value
is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max).

Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping
configuration, the user agent may round to the nearest valid value,
preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally
close options.

For date inputs, the value of step is given in days; and is treated as a
number of milliseconds equal to 86,400,000 times the step value (the
underlying numeric value is in milliseconds). The default value of step
is 1, indicating 1 day.

Note: Specifying any as the value for step has the same effect as 1 for
date inputs.

Using date inputs

Date inputs provide an easy interface for choosing dates, and they
normalize the data format sent to the server regardless of the user's
locale.

In this section, we'll look at basic and then more complex uses of
<input type="date">.

Basic uses of date

The simplest use of <input type="date"> involves one <input> combined
with its <label>, as seen below:

html

    <form action="https://example.com">
      <label>
        Enter your birthday:
        <input type="date" name="bday" />
      </label>

      <p><button>Submit</button></p>
    </form>

This HTML submits the entered date under the key bday to
https://example.com — resulting in a URL like
https://example.com/?bday=1955-06-08.

Setting maximum and minimum dates

You can use the min and max attributes to restrict the dates that can be
chosen by the user. In the following example, we set a minimum date of
2017-04-01 and a maximum date of 2017-04-30:

html

    <form>
      <label>
        Choose your preferred party date:
        <input type="date" name="party" min="2017-04-01" max="2017-04-30" />
      </label>
    </form>

The result is that only days in April 2017 can be selected — the month
and year parts of the textbox will be uneditable, and dates outside
April 2017 can't be selected in the picker widget.

Note: You should be able to use the step attribute to vary the number of
days jumped each time the date is incremented (e.g. to only make
Saturdays selectable). However, this does not seem to be in any
implementation at the time of writing.

Controlling input size

<input type="date"> doesn't support form sizing attributes such as size.
Prefer CSS for sizing it.

Validation

By default, <input type="date"> doesn't validate the entered value
beyond its format. The interfaces generally don't let you enter anything
that isn't a date — which is helpful — but you can leave the field empty
or enter an invalid date in browsers where the input falls back to type
text (like the 32nd of April).

If you use min and max to restrict the available dates (see Setting
maximum and minimum dates), supporting browsers will display an error if
you try to submit a date that is out of bounds. However, you'll need to
double-check the submitted results to ensure the value is within these
dates, if the date picker isn't fully supported on the user's device.

You can also use the required attribute to make filling in the date
mandatory — an error will be displayed if you try to submit an empty
date field. This should work in most browsers, even if they fall back to
a text input.

Let's look at an example of minimum and maximum dates, and also made a
field required:

html

    <form>
      <label>
        Choose your preferred party date (required, April 1st to 20th):
        <input
          type="date"
          name="party"
          min="2017-04-01"
          max="2017-04-20"
          required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </label>

      <p>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </p>
    </form>

If you try to submit the form with an incomplete date (or with a date
outside the set bounds), the browser displays an error. Try playing with
the example now:

Here's the CSS used in the above example. We make use of the :valid and
:invalid pseudo-elements to add an icon next to the input, based on
whether the current value is valid. We had to put the icon on a <span>
next to the input, not on the input itself, because in Chrome at least
the input's generated content is placed inside the form control, and
can't be styled or shown effectively.

css

    label {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
    }

    span::after {
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      content: "✖";
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      content: "✓";
    }

Warning: Client-side form validation is no substitute for validating on
the server. It's easy for someone to modify the HTML, or bypass your
HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your
server fails to validate the received data, disaster could strike with
data that is badly-formatted, too large, of the wrong type, etc.

Handling browser support

Browsers that don't support this input type gracefully degrade to a text
input, but this creates problems in consistency of user interface (the
presented controls are different) and data handling.

The second problem is the more serious one; with date input supported,
the value is normalized to the format yyyy-mm-dd. But with a text input,
the browser has no recognition of what format the date should be in, and
there are many formats in which people write dates. For example:

-   ddmmyyyy
-   dd/mm/yyyy
-   mm/dd/yyyy
-   dd-mm-yyyy
-   mm-dd-yyyy
-   Month dd, yyyy

One way around this is the pattern attribute on your date input. Even
though the date picker doesn't use it, the text input fallback will. For
example, try viewing the following in an unsupporting browser:

html

    <form>
      <label>
        Enter your birthday:
        <input type="date" name="bday" required pattern="\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </label>
      <p>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </p>
    </form>

If you submit it, you'll see that the browser displays an error and
highlights the input as invalid if your entry doesn't match the pattern
####-##-## (where # is a digit from 0 to 9). Of course, this doesn't
stop people from entering invalid dates, or incorrect formats. So we
still have a problem.

    span {
      position: relative;
    }

    span::after {
      right: -18px;
      position: absolute;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      content: "✖";
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      content: "✓";
    }

At the moment, the best way to deal with dates in forms in a
cross-browser way is to have the user enter the day, month, and year in
separate controls, or to use a JavaScript library such as jQuery date
picker.

Examples

In this example, we create 2 sets of UI elements for choosing dates: a
native <input type="date"> picker and a set of 3 <select> elements for
older browsers that don't support the native date input.

HTML

The HTML looks like so:

html

    <form>
      <div class="nativeDatePicker">
        <label for="bday">Enter your birthday:</label>
        <input type="date" id="bday" name="bday" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <p class="fallbackLabel">Enter your birthday:</p>
      <div class="fallbackDatePicker">
        <span>
          <label for="day">Day:</label>
          <select id="day" name="day"></select>
        </span>
        <span>
          <label for="month">Month:</label>
          <select id="month" name="month">
            <option selected>January</option>
            <option>February</option>
            <option>March</option>
            <option>April</option>
            <option>May</option>
            <option>June</option>
            <option>July</option>
            <option>August</option>
            <option>September</option>
            <option>October</option>
            <option>November</option>
            <option>December</option>
          </select>
        </span>
        <span>
          <label for="year">Year:</label>
          <select id="year" name="year"></select>
        </span>
      </div>
    </form>

The months are hardcoded (as they are always the same), while the day
and year values are dynamically generated depending on the currently
selected month and year, and the current year (see the code comments
below for detailed explanations of how these functions work.)

    span {
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      content: "✖";
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      content: "✓";
    }

JavaScript

The other part of the code that may be of interest is the feature
detection code — to detect whether the browser supports
<input type="date">.

We create a new <input> element, try setting its type to date, then
immediately check what its type is — unsupporting browsers will return
text, because the date type falls back to type text. If
<input type="date"> isn't supported, we hide the native picker and show
the fallback (<select>) instead.

js

    // Obtain UI widgets
    const nativePicker = document.querySelector(".nativeDatePicker");
    const fallbackPicker = document.querySelector(".fallbackDatePicker");
    const fallbackLabel = document.querySelector(".fallbackLabel");

    const yearSelect = document.querySelector("#year");
    const monthSelect = document.querySelector("#month");
    const daySelect = document.querySelector("#day");

    // hide fallback initially
    fallbackPicker.style.display = "none";
    fallbackLabel.style.display = "none";

    // test whether a new date input falls back to a text input or not
    const test = document.createElement("input");

    try {
      test.type = "date";
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e.message);
    }

    // if it does, run the code inside the if () {} block
    if (test.type === "text") {
      // hide the native picker and show the fallback
      nativePicker.style.display = "none";
      fallbackPicker.style.display = "block";
      fallbackLabel.style.display = "block";

      // populate the days and years dynamically
      // (the months are always the same, therefore hardcoded)
      populateDays(monthSelect.value);
      populateYears();
    }

    function populateDays(month) {
      // delete the current set of <option> elements out of the
      // day <select>, ready for the next set to be injected
      while (daySelect.firstChild) {
        daySelect.removeChild(daySelect.firstChild);
      }

      // Create variable to hold new number of days to inject
      let dayNum;

      // 31 or 30 days?
      if (
        [
          "January",
          "March",
          "May",
          "July",
          "August",
          "October",
          "December",
        ].includes(month)
      ) {
        dayNum = 31;
      } else if (["April", "June", "September", "November"].includes(month)) {
        dayNum = 30;
      } else {
        // If month is February, calculate whether it is a leap year or not
        const year = yearSelect.value;
        const isLeap = new Date(year, 1, 29).getMonth() === 1;
        dayNum = isLeap ? 29 : 28;
      }

      // inject the right number of new <option> elements into the day <select>
      for (let i = 1; i <= dayNum; i++) {
        const option = document.createElement("option");
        option.textContent = i;
        daySelect.appendChild(option);
      }

      // if previous day has already been set, set daySelect's value
      // to that day, to avoid the day jumping back to 1 when you
      // change the year
      if (previousDay) {
        daySelect.value = previousDay;

        // If the previous day was set to a high number, say 31, and then
        // you chose a month with less total days in it (e.g. February),
        // this part of the code ensures that the highest day available
        // is selected, rather than showing a blank daySelect
        if (daySelect.value === "") {
          daySelect.value = previousDay - 1;
        }

        if (daySelect.value === "") {
          daySelect.value = previousDay - 2;
        }

        if (daySelect.value === "") {
          daySelect.value = previousDay - 3;
        }
      }
    }

    function populateYears() {
      // get this year as a number
      const date = new Date();
      const year = date.getFullYear();

      // Make this year, and the 100 years before it available in the year <select>
      for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
        const option = document.createElement("option");
        option.textContent = year - i;
        yearSelect.appendChild(option);
      }
    }

    // when the month or year <select> values are changed, rerun populateDays()
    // in case the change affected the number of available days
    yearSelect.onchange = () => {
      populateDays(monthSelect.value);
    };

    monthSelect.onchange = () => {
      populateDays(monthSelect.value);
    };

    //preserve day selection
    let previousDay;

    // update what day has been set to previously
    // see end of populateDays() for usage
    daySelect.onchange = () => {
      previousDay = daySelect.value;
    };

Note: Remember that some years have 53 weeks in them (see Weeks per
year)! You'll need to take this into consideration when developing
production apps.

# <input type="datetime-local">#

<input> elements of type datetime-local create input controls that let
the user easily enter both a date and a time, including the year, month,
and day as well as the time in hours and minutes.

The control's UI varies in general from browser to browser. In browsers
with no support, these degrade gracefully to simple <input type="text">
controls.

The control is intended to represent a local date and time, not
necessarily the user's local date and time. In other words, the input
allows any valid combination of year, month, day, hour, and minute—even
if such a combination is invalid in the user's local time zone (such as
the one hour within a daylight saving time spring-forward transition
gap).

Value

A string representing the value of the date entered into the input. The
format of the date and time value used by this input type is described
in Local date and time strings.

You can set a default value for the input by including a date and time
inside the value attribute, like so:

html

    <label for="party">Enter a date and time for your party booking:</label>
    <input
      id="party"
      type="datetime-local"
      name="partydate"
      value="2017-06-01T08:30" />

One thing to note is that the displayed date and time formats differ
from the actual value; the displayed date and time are formatted
according to the user's locale as reported by their operating system,
whereas the date/time value is always formatted YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm. When
the above value is submitted to the server, for example, it will look
like partydate=2024-06-01T08:30.

Note: Also bear in mind that if such data is submitted via HTTP GET, the
colon character will need to be escaped for inclusion in the URL
parameters, e.g. partydate=2024-06-01T08%3A30. See encodeURI() for one
way to do this.

You can also get and set the date value in JavaScript using the
HTMLInputElement value property, for example:

js

    const dateControl = document.querySelector('input[type="datetime-local"]');
    dateControl.value = "2017-06-01T08:30";

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes common to all <input> elements,
datetime-local inputs offer the following attributes.

max

The latest date and time to accept. If the value entered into the
element is later than this timestamp, the element fails constraint
validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a valid string that
follows the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm, then the element has no maximum
value.

This value must specify a date string later than or equal to the one
specified by the min attribute.

min

The earliest date and time to accept; timestamps earlier than this will
cause the element to fail constraint validation. If the value of the min
attribute isn't a valid string that follows the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm,
then the element has no minimum value.

This value must specify a date string earlier than or equal to the one
specified by the max attribute.

step

The step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the
value must adhere to, or the special value any, which is described
below. Only values which are equal to the basis for stepping (min if
specified, value otherwise, and an appropriate default value if neither
of those is provided) are valid.

A string value of any means that no stepping is implied, and any value
is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max).

Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping
configuration, the user agent may round to the nearest valid value,
preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally
close options.

For datetime-local inputs, the value of step is given in seconds, with a
scaling factor of 1000 (since the underlying numeric value is in
milliseconds). The default value of step is 60, indicating 60 seconds
(or 1 minute, or 60,000 milliseconds).

At this time, it's unclear what a value of any means for step when used
with datetime-local inputs. This will be updated as soon as that
information is determined.

Using datetime-local inputs

Date/time inputs are convenient for the developer; they provide an easy
UI for choosing dates and times, and they normalize the data format sent
to the server, regardless of the user's locale. However, it is important
to consider your users. Don't require your users to enter data that is
not needed for your app to function.

Controlling input size

<input type="datetime-local"> doesn't support form control sizing
attributes such as size. You'll have to resort to CSS for customizing
the sizes of these elements.

Setting timezones

One thing the datetime-local input type doesn't provide is a way to set
the time zone and/or locale of the date/time control. This was available
in the datetime input type, but this type is now obsolete, having been
removed from the spec. The main reasons why this was removed are a lack
of implementation in browsers and concerns over the user
interface/experience. It is easier to just have a control (or controls)
for setting the date/time and then deal with the locale in a separate
control.

For example, if you are creating a system where the user is likely to
already be logged in, with their locale already set, you could provide
the timezone in a hidden input type. For example:

html

    <input type="hidden" id="timezone" name="timezone" value="-08:00" />

On the other hand, if you were required to allow the user to enter a
time zone along with a date/time input, you could have a <select>
element to enable the user to set the right time zone by choosing a
particular location from among a set of locations:

html

    <select name="timezone" id="timezone">
      <option value="Pacific/Kwajalein">Eniwetok, Kwajalein</option>
      <option value="Pacific/Midway">Midway Island, Samoa</option>
      <option value="Pacific/Honolulu">Hawaii</option>
      <option value="Pacific/Marquesas">Taiohae</option>
      <!-- and so on -->
    </select>

In either case, the date/time and time zone values would be submitted to
the server as separate data points, and then you'd need to store them
appropriately in the database on the server-side.

Validation

By default, <input type="datetime-local"> does not apply any validation
to entered values. The UI implementations generally don't let you enter
anything that isn't a date/time — which is helpful — but a user might
still fill in no value and submit, or enter an invalid date and/or time
(e.g. the 32nd of April).

You can use min and max to restrict the available dates (see Setting
maximum and minimum dates), and you can use the required attribute to
make filling in the date/time mandatory. As a result, supporting
browsers will display an error if you try to submit a date that is
outside the set bounds or an empty date field.

Let's look at an example; here we've set minimum and maximum date/time
values, and also made the field required:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="party">
          Choose your preferred party date and time (required, June 1st 8.30am to
          June 30th 4.30pm):
        </label>
        <input
          id="party"
          type="datetime-local"
          name="partydate"
          min="2017-06-01T08:30"
          max="2017-06-30T16:30"
          required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Book party!" />
      </div>
    </form>

If you try to submit the form with an incomplete date (or with a date
outside the set bounds), the browser displays an error. Try playing with
the example now:

Here's the CSS used in the above example. Here we make use of the :valid
and :invalid CSS properties to style the input based on whether the
current value is valid. We put the icons on a <span> next to the input.

css

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
    }

    label {
      display: inline-block;
      width: 300px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

Warning: HTML form validation is not a substitute for scripts that
ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy
for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass
the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone
to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your
server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives,
problems can arise when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or data
that is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth).

Note: With a datetime-local input, the date value is always normalized
to the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm.

Examples

Basic uses of datetime-local

The simplest use of <input type="datetime-local"> involves a basic
<input> and <label> element combination, as seen below:

html

    <form>
      <label for="party">Enter a date and time for your party booking:</label>
      <input id="party" type="datetime-local" name="partydate" />
    </form>

Setting maximum and minimum dates and times

You can use the min and max attributes to restrict the dates/times that
can be chosen by the user. In the following example, we are setting a
minimum datetime of 2024-06-01T08:30 and a maximum datetime of
2024-06-30T16:30:

html

    <form>
      <label for="party">Enter a date and time for your party booking:</label>
      <input
        id="party"

        min="2024-06-01T08:30"
        max="2024-06-30T16:30" />
    </form>

Only days in June 2024 can be selected. Depending on what browser you
are using, times outside the specified values might not be selectable.
In other browsers, invalid dates and times are selectable but will match
:invalid and :out-of-range and will fail validation.

In some browsers (Chrome and Edge), only the "days" part of the date
value will be editable, and dates outside June can't be scrolled. In
others (Safari), the date picker will appear to allow any date, but the
value will be clamped to the valid range when a date is selected.

The valid range included all times between the min and max values; the
time of day is only constrained on the first and last dates in the
range.

Note: You should be able to use the step attribute to vary the number of
days jumped each time the date is incremented (e.g. maybe you only want
to make Saturdays selectable). However, this does not seem to work
effectively in any implementation at the time of writing.

# <input type="email">#

<input> elements of type email are used to let the user enter and edit
an email address, or, if the multiple attribute is specified, a list of
email addresses.

The input value is automatically validated to ensure that it's either
empty or a properly-formatted email address (or list of addresses)
before the form can be submitted. The :valid and :invalid CSS
pseudo-classes are automatically applied as appropriate to visually
denote whether the current value of the field is a valid email address
or not.

Value

The <input> element's value attribute contains a string which is
automatically validated as conforming to email syntax. More
specifically, there are three possible value formats that will pass
validation:

1.  An empty string ("") indicating that the user did not enter a value
    or that the value was removed.
2.  A single properly-formed email address. This doesn't necessarily
    mean the email address exists, but it is at least formatted
    correctly. In simple terms, this means username@domain or
    username@domain.tld. There's more to it than that, of course; see
    Validation for a regular expression that matches the email address
    validation algorithm.
3.  If and only if the multiple attribute is specified, the value can be
    a list of properly-formed comma-separated email addresses. Any
    trailing and leading whitespace is removed from each address in the
    list.

See Validation for details on how email addresses are validated to
ensure that they're formatted properly.

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes that operate on all <input> elements
regardless of their type, email inputs support the following attributes.

list

The values of the list attribute is the id of a <datalist> element
located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of
predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in
the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the
suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not
requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a
different value.

maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the email input. This must be an integer value of 0 or
higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified,
the email input has no maximum length. This value must also be greater
than or equal to the value of minlength.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
value of the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long.
Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the
user.

minlength

The minimum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the email input. This must be a non-negative integer
value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no
minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the email
input has no minimum length.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long.
Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the
user.

multiple

A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user can enter
a list of multiple email addresses, separated by commas and, optionally,
whitespace characters. See Allowing multiple email addresses for an
example, or HTML attribute: multiple for more details.

Note: Normally, if you specify the required attribute, the user must
enter a valid email address for the field to be considered valid.
However, if you add the multiple attribute, a list of zero email
addresses (an empty string, or one which is entirely whitespace) is a
valid value. In other words, the user does not have to enter even one
email address when multiple is specified, regardless of the value of
required.

pattern

The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the
input's value must match for the value to pass constraint validation. It
must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp
type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u'
flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the
pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as
ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular
expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

Note: Use the title attribute to specify text that most browsers will
display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the
pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

See the section Pattern validation for details and an example.

placeholder

The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the
user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should
be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data,
rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage
returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality (LTR or RTL) but needs
to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use
Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override
directionality within the placeholder; see How to use Unicode controls
for bidi text for more information.

Note: Avoid using the placeholder attribute if you can. It is not as
semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause
unexpected technical issues with your content. See <input> labels for
more information.

readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited
by the user. Its value can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code
directly setting the HTMLInputElement value property.

Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not
have any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

size

The size attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters
wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than
zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may
or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the
resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of
characters, depending on the characters and the font (font settings in
use).

This does not set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into
the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a
time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the
maxlength attribute.

Using email inputs

Email addresses are among the most frequently-inputted textual data
forms on the web; they're used when logging into websites, when
requesting information, to allow order confirmation, for webmail, and so
forth. As such, the email input type can make your job as a web
developer much easier since it can help simplify your work when building
the user interface and logic for email addresses. When you create an
email input with the proper type value, email, you get automatic
validation that the entered text is at least in the correct form to
potentially be a legitimate email address. This can help avoid cases in
which the user mistypes their address, or provides an invalid address.

It's important, however, to note that this is not enough to ensure that
the specified text is an email address which actually exists,
corresponds to the user of the site, or is acceptable in any other way.
It ensures that the value of the field is properly formatted to be an
email address.

Note: It's also crucial to remember that a user can tinker with your
HTML behind the scenes, so your site must not use this validation for
any security purposes. You must verify the email address on the server
side of any transaction in which the provided text may have any security
implications of any kind.

A simple email input

Currently, all browsers which implement this element implement it as a
standard text input field with basic validation features. The
specification does, however, allow browsers latitude on this. For
example, the element could be integrated with the user's device's
built-in address book to allow picking email addresses from that list.
In its most basic form, an email input can be implemented like this:

html

    <input id="emailAddress" type="email" />

Notice that it's considered valid when empty and when a single
validly-formatted email address is entered, but is otherwise not
considered valid. By adding the required attribute, only validly-formed
email addresses are allowed; the input is no longer considered valid
when empty.

Allowing multiple email addresses

By adding the multiple Boolean attribute, the input can be configured to
accept multiple email addresses.

html

    <input id="emailAddress" type="email" multiple />

The input is now considered valid when a single email address is
entered, or when any number of email addresses separated by commas and,
optionally, some number of whitespace characters are present.

Note: When multiple is used, the value is allowed to be empty.

Some examples of valid strings when multiple is specified:

-   ""
-   "me@example"
-   "me@example.org"
-   "me@example.org,you@example.org"
-   "me@example.org, you@example.org"
-   "me@example.org,you@example.org, us@example.org"

Some examples of invalid strings:

-   ","
-   "me"
-   "me@example.org you@example.org"

Placeholders

Sometimes it's helpful to offer an in-context hint as to what form the
input data should take. This can be especially important if the page
design doesn't offer descriptive labels for each <input>. This is where
placeholders come in. A placeholder is a value that demonstrates the
form the value should take by presenting an example of a valid value,
which is displayed inside the edit box when the element's value is "".
Once data is entered into the box, the placeholder disappears; if the
box is emptied, the placeholder reappears.

Here, we have an email input with the placeholder sophie@example.com.
Note how the placeholder disappears and reappears as you manipulate the
contents of the edit field.

html

    <input type="email" placeholder="sophie@example.com" />

Controlling the input size

You can control not only the physical length of the input box, but also
the minimum and maximum lengths allowed for the input text itself.

Physical input element size

The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the size
attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the input
box can display at a time. In this example the email edit box is 15
characters wide:

html

    <input type="email" size="15" />

Element value length

The size is separate from the length limitation on the entered email
address itself so that you can have fields fit in a small space while
still allowing longer email address strings to be entered. You can
specify a minimum length, in characters, for the entered email address
using the minlength attribute; similarly, use maxlength to set the
maximum length of the entered email address.

The example below creates a 32 character-wide email address entry box,
requiring that the contents be no shorter than 3 characters and no
longer than 64 characters.

html

    <input type="email" size="32" minlength="3" maxlength="64" />

Providing default options

Providing a single default using the value attribute

As always, you can provide a default value for an email input box by
setting its value attribute:

html

    <input type="email" value="default@example.com" />

Offering suggested values

Taking it a step further, you can provide a list of default options from
which the user can select by specifying the list attribute. This doesn't
limit the user to those options, but does allow them to select
commonly-used email addresses more quickly. This also offers hints to
autocomplete. The list attribute specifies the ID of a <datalist>, which
in turn contains one <option> element per suggested value; each option's
value is the corresponding suggested value for the email entry box.

html

    <input type="email" size="40" list="defaultEmails" />

    <datalist id="defaultEmails">
      <option value="jbond007@mi6.defence.gov.uk"></option>
      <option value="jbourne@unknown.net"></option>
      <option value="nfury@shield.org"></option>
      <option value="tony@starkindustries.com"></option>
      <option value="hulk@grrrrrrrr.arg"></option>
    </datalist>

With the <datalist> element and its <option>s in place, the browser will
offer the specified values as potential values for the email address;
this is typically presented as a popup or drop-down menu containing the
suggestions. While the specific user experience may vary from one
browser to another, typically clicking in the edit box presents a
drop-down of the suggested email addresses. Then, as the user types, the
list is filtered to show only matching values. Each typed character
narrows down the list until the user makes a selection or types a custom
value.

Validation

There are two levels of content validation available for email inputs.
First, there's the standard level of validation offered to all <input>s,
which automatically ensures that the contents meet the requirements to
be a valid email address. But there's also the option to add additional
filtering to ensure that your own specialized needs are met, if you have
any.

Warning: HTML form validation is not a substitute for scripts that
ensure that the entered data is in the proper format.It's far too easy
for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass
the validation, or to remove it completely. It's also possible for
someone to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to
your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it
receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data (or data
which is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into
your database.

Basic validation

Browsers automatically provide validation to ensure that only text that
matches the standard format for Internet email addresses is entered into
the input box. Browsers use an algorithm equivalent to the following
regular expression:

js

    /^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$/;

To learn more about how form validation works and how to take advantage
of the :valid and :invalid CSS properties to style the input based on
whether the current value is valid, see Form data validation.

Note: There are known specification issues related to international
domain names and the validation of email addresses in HTML. See W3C bug
15489 for details.

Pattern validation

If you need the entered email address to be restricted further than just
"any string that looks like an email address," you can use the pattern
attribute to specify a regular expression the value must match for it to
be valid. If the multiple attribute is specified, each individual item
in the comma-delineated list of values must match the regular
expression.

For example, let's say you're building a page for employees of Best
Startup Ever, Inc. which will let them contact their IT department for
help. In our simplified form, the user needs to enter their email
address and a message describing the problem they need help with. We
want to ensure that not only does the user provide a valid email
address, but for security purposes, we require that the address be an
internal corporate email address.

Since inputs of type email validate against both the standard email
address validation and the specified pattern, you can implement this
easily. Let's see how:

    body {
      font: 16px sans-serif;
    }

    .emailBox {
      padding-bottom: 20px;
    }

    .messageBox {
      padding-bottom: 20px;
    }

    label {
      line-height: 22px;
    }

    label::after {
      content: ":";
    }

html

    <form>
      <div class="emailBox">
        <label for="emailAddress">Your email address</label><br />
        <input
          id="emailAddress"
          type="email"
          size="64"
          maxlength="64"
          required
          placeholder="username@beststartupever.com"
          pattern=".+@beststartupever\.com"
          title="Please provide only a Best Startup Ever corporate email address" />
      </div>

      <div class="messageBox">
        <label for="message">Request</label><br />
        <textarea
          id="message"
          cols="80"
          rows="8"
          required
          placeholder="My shoes are too tight, and I have forgotten how to dance."></textarea>
      </div>
      <input type="submit" value="Send Request" />
    </form>

Our <form> contains one <input> of type email for the user's email
address, a <textarea> to enter their message for IT into, and an <input>
of type "submit", which creates a button to submit the form. Each text
entry box has a <label> associated with it to let the user know what's
expected of them.

Let's take a closer look at the email address entry box. Its size and
maxlength attributes are both set to 64 in order to show room for 64
characters worth of email address, and to limit the number of characters
actually entered to a maximum of 64. The required attribute is
specified, making it mandatory that a valid email address be provided.

An appropriate placeholder is provided—username@beststartupever.com—to
demonstrate what constitutes a valid entry. This string demonstrates
both that an email address should be entered, and suggests that it
should be a corporate beststartupever.com account. This is in addition
to the fact that using type email will validate the text to ensure that
it's formatted like an email address. If the text in the input box isn't
an email address, you'll get an error message that looks something like
this:

[Invalid email address in error state with a popout from the input
reading 'please enter an email address'.]

If we left things at that, we would at least be validating on legitimate
email addresses. But we want to go one step farther: we want to make
sure that the email address is in fact in the form
"_username_@beststartupever.com". This is where we'll use pattern. We
set pattern to .+@beststartupever.com. This simple regular expression
requests a string that consists of at least one character of any kind,
then an "@" followed by the domain name "beststartupever.com".

Note that this is not even close to an adequate filter for valid email
addresses; it would allow things such as " @beststartupever.com" (note
the leading space) or "@@beststartupever.com", neither of which is
valid. However, the browser runs both the standard email address filter
and our custom pattern against the specified text. As a result, we wind
up with a validation which says "make sure this resembles a valid email
address, and if it is, make sure it's also a beststartupever.com
address."

It's advisable to use the title attribute along with pattern. If you do,
the title must describe the pattern. That is, it should explain what
format the data should take on, rather than any other information.
That's because the title may be displayed or spoken as part of a
validation error message. For example, the browser might present the
message "The entered text doesn't match the required pattern." followed
by your specified title. If your title is something like "Email
address", the result would be the message "The entered text doesn't
match the required pattern. Email address", which isn't very good.

That's why, instead, we specify the string "Please provide only a Best
Startup Ever corporate email address" By doing that, the resulting full
error message might be something like "The entered text doesn't match
the required pattern. Please provide only a Best Startup Ever corporate
email address."

[A valid email address, but the input is in error state with a popout
from the input reading 'The entered text doesn't match the required
pattern. Please provide only a Best Startup Ever corporate email
address.']

Note: If you run into trouble while writing your validation regular
expressions and they're not working properly, check your browser's
console; there may be helpful error messages there to aid you in solving
the problem.

Examples

Here we have an email input with the ID emailAddress which is allowed to
be up to a maximum of 256 characters long. The input box itself is
physically 64 characters wide, and displays the text user@example.gov as
a placeholder anytime the field is empty. In addition, by using the
multiple attribute, the box is configured to allow the user to enter
zero or more email addresses, separated by commas, as described in
Allowing multiple email addresses. As a final touch, the list attribute
contains the ID of a <datalist> whose <option>s specify a set of
suggested values the user can choose from.

As an added touch, the <label> element is used to establish a label for
the email entry box, with its for attribute referencing the emailAddress
ID of the <input> element. By associating the two elements in this way,
clicking on the label will focus the input element.

html

    <label for="emailAddress">Email</label><br />
    <input
      id="emailAddress"
      type="email"
      placeholder="user@example.gov"

      multiple />

Value

A file input's value attribute contains a string that represents the
path to the selected file(s). If no file is selected yet, the value is
an empty string (""). When the user selected multiple files, the value
represents the first file in the list of files they selected. The other
files can be identified using the input's HTMLInputElement.files
property.

Note: The value is always the file's name prefixed with C:\fakepath\,
which isn't the real path of the file. This is to prevent malicious
software from guessing the user's file structure.

Additional attributes

In addition to the common attributes shared by all <input> elements,
inputs of type file also support the following attributes.

accept

The accept attribute value is a string that defines the file types the
file input should accept. This string is a comma-separated list of
unique file type specifiers. Because a given file type may be identified
in more than one manner, it's useful to provide a thorough set of type
specifiers when you need files of a given format.

For instance, there are a number of ways Microsoft Word files can be
identified, so a site that accepts Word files might use an <input> like
this:

html

    <input
      type="file"
      id="docpicker"
      accept=".doc,.docx,.xml,application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" />

capture

The capture attribute value is a string that specifies which camera to
use for capture of image or video data, if the accept attribute
indicates that the input should be of one of those types. A value of
user indicates that the user-facing camera and/or microphone should be
used. A value of environment specifies that the outward-facing camera
and/or microphone should be used. If this attribute is missing, the user
agent is free to decide on its own what to do. If the requested facing
mode isn't available, the user agent may fall back to its preferred
default mode.

Note: capture was previously a Boolean attribute which, if present,
requested that the device's media capture device(s) such as camera or
microphone be used instead of requesting a file input.

multiple

When the multiple Boolean attribute is specified, the file input allows
the user to select more than one file.

Non-standard attributes

In addition to the attributes listed above, the following non-standard
attributes are available on some browsers. You should try to avoid using
them when possible, since doing so will limit the ability of your code
to function in browsers that don't implement them.

webkitdirectory

The Boolean webkitdirectory attribute, if present, indicates that only
directories should be available to be selected by the user in the file
picker interface. See HTMLInputElement.webkitdirectory for additional
details and examples.

Though originally implemented only for WebKit-based browsers,
webkitdirectory is also usable in Microsoft Edge as well as Firefox 50
and later. However, even though it has relatively broad support, it is
still not standard and should not be used unless you have no
alternative.

Unique file type specifiers

A unique file type specifier is a string that describes a type of file
that may be selected by the user in an <input> element of type file.
Each unique file type specifier may take one of the following forms:

-   A valid case-insensitive filename extension, starting with a period
    (".") character. For example: .jpg, .pdf, or .doc.
-   A valid MIME type string, with no extensions.
-   The string audio/* meaning "any audio file".
-   The string video/* meaning "any video file".
-   The string image/* meaning "any image file".

The accept attribute takes a string containing one or more of these
unique file type specifiers as its value, separated by commas. For
example, a file picker that needs content that can be presented as an
image, including both standard image formats and PDF files, might look
like this:

html

    <input type="file" accept="image/*,.pdf" />

Using file inputs

A basic example

html

    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <div>
        <label for="file">Choose file to upload</label>
        <input type="file" id="file" name="file" multiple />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

This produces the following output:

Note: You can find this example on GitHub too — see the source code, and
also see it running live.

Regardless of the user's device or operating system, the file input
provides a button that opens up a file picker dialog that allows the
user to choose a file.

Including the multiple attribute, as shown above, specifies that
multiple files can be chosen at once. The user can choose multiple files
from the file picker in any way that their chosen platform allows (e.g.
by holding down Shift or Control and then clicking). If you only want
the user to choose a single file per <input>, omit the multiple
attribute.

Getting information on selected files

The selected files' are returned by the element's HTMLInputElement.files
property, which is a FileList object containing a list of File objects.
The FileList behaves like an array, so you can check its length property
to get the number of selected files.

Each File object contains the following information:

name

    The file's name.

lastModified

    A number specifying the date and time at which the file was last
    modified, in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970, at
    midnight).

lastModifiedDate Deprecated

    A Date object representing the date and time at which the file was
    last modified. This is deprecated and should not be used. Use
    lastModified instead.

size

    The size of the file in bytes.

type

    The file's MIME type.

webkitRelativePath Non-standard

    A string specifying the file's path relative to the base directory
    selected in a directory picker (that is, a file picker in which the
    webkitdirectory attribute is set). This is non-standard and should
    be used with caution.

Note: You can set as well as get the value of HTMLInputElement.files in
all modern browsers; this was most recently added to Firefox, in version
57 (see Firefox bug 1384030).

Limiting accepted file types

Often you won't want the user to be able to pick any arbitrary type of
file; instead, you often want them to select files of a specific type or
types. For example, if your file input lets users upload a profile
picture, you probably want them to select web-compatible image formats,
such as JPEG or PNG.

Acceptable file types can be specified with the accept attribute, which
takes a comma-separated list of allowed file extensions or MIME types.
Some examples:

-   accept="image/png" or accept=".png" — Accepts PNG files.
-   accept="image/png, image/jpeg" or accept=".png, .jpg, .jpeg" —
    Accept PNG or JPEG files.
-   accept="image/*" — Accept any file with an image/* MIME type. (Many
    mobile devices also let the user take a picture with the camera when
    this is used.)
-   accept=".doc,.docx,.xml,application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"
    — accept anything that smells like an MS Word document.

Let's look at a more complete example:

html

    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <div>
        <label for="profile_pic">Choose file to upload</label>
        <input
          type="file"
          id="profile_pic"
          name="profile_pic"
          accept=".jpg, .jpeg, .png" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

This produces a similar-looking output to the previous example:

Note: You can find this example on GitHub too — see the source code, and
also see it running live.

It may look similar, but if you try selecting a file with this input,
you'll see that the file picker only lets you select the file types
specified in the accept value (the exact interface differs across
browsers and operating systems).

The accept attribute doesn't validate the types of the selected files;
it provides hints for browsers to guide users towards selecting the
correct file types. It is still possible (in most cases) for users to
toggle an option in the file chooser that makes it possible to override
this and select any file they wish, and then choose incorrect file
types.

Because of this, you should make sure that the accept attribute is
backed up by appropriate server-side validation.

Detecting cancellations

The cancel event is fired when the user does not change their selection,
reselecting the previously selected files. The cancel event is also
fired when the file picker dialog gets closed, or canceled, via the
"cancel" button or the escape key.

For example, the following code will log to the console if the user
closes the popup without selecting a file:

js

    const elem = document.createElement("input");
    elem.type = "file";
    elem.addEventListener("cancel", () => {
      console.log("Cancelled.");
    });
    elem.addEventListener("change", () => {
      if (elem.files.length == 1) {
        console.log("File selected: ", elem.files[0]);
      }
    });
    elem.click();

Notes

1.  You cannot set the value of a file picker from a script — doing
    something like the following has no effect:
    js

        const input = document.querySelector("input[type=file]");
        input.value = "foo";
2.  When a file is chosen using an <input type="file">, the real path to
    the source file is not shown in the input's value attribute for
    obvious security reasons. Instead, the filename is shown, with
    C:\fakepath\ prepended to it. There are some historical reasons for
    this quirk, but it is supported across all modern browsers, and in
    fact is defined in the spec.

Examples

In this example, we'll present a slightly more advanced file chooser
that takes advantage of the file information available in the
HTMLInputElement.files property, as well as showing off a few clever
tricks.

Note: You can see the complete source code for this example on GitHub —
file-example.html (see it live also). We won't explain the CSS; the
JavaScript is the main focus.

First of all, let's look at the HTML:

html

    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <div>
        <label for="image_uploads">Choose images to upload (PNG, JPG)</label>
        <input
          type="file"
          id="image_uploads"
          name="image_uploads"
          accept=".jpg, .jpeg, .png"
          multiple />
      </div>
      <div class="preview">
        <p>No files currently selected for upload</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    html {
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }

    form {
      background: #ccc;
      margin: 0 auto;
      padding: 20px;
      border: 1px solid black;
    }

    form ol {
      padding-left: 0;
    }

    form li,
    div > p {
      background: #eee;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      list-style-type: none;
      border: 1px solid black;
    }

    form img {
      height: 64px;
      order: 1;
    }

    form p {
      line-height: 32px;
      padding-left: 10px;
    }

    form label,
    form button {
      background-color: #7f9ccb;
      padding: 5px 10px;
      border-radius: 5px;
      border: 1px ridge black;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      height: auto;
    }

    form label:hover,
    form button:hover {
      background-color: #2d5ba3;
      color: white;
    }

    form label:active,
    form button:active {
      background-color: #0d3f8f;
      color: white;
    }

This is similar to what we've seen before — nothing special to comment
on.

Next, let's walk through the JavaScript.

In the first lines of script, we get references to the form input
itself, and the <div> element with the class of .preview. Next, we hide
the <input> element — we do this because file inputs tend to be ugly,
difficult to style, and inconsistent in their design across browsers.
You can activate the input element by clicking its <label>, so it is
better to visually hide the input and style the label like a button, so
the user will know to interact with it if they want to upload files.

js

    const input = document.querySelector("input");
    const preview = document.querySelector(".preview");

    input.style.opacity = 0;

Note: opacity is used to hide the file input instead of
visibility: hidden or display: none, because assistive technology
interprets the latter two styles to mean the file input isn't
interactive.

Next, we add an event listener to the input to listen for changes to its
selected value (in this case, when files are selected). The event
listener invokes our custom updateImageDisplay() function.

js

    input.addEventListener("change", updateImageDisplay);

Whenever the updateImageDisplay() function is invoked, we:

-   Use a while loop to empty the previous contents of the preview
    <div>.
-   Grab the FileList object that contains the information on all the
    selected files, and store it in a variable called curFiles.
-   Check to see if no files were selected, by checking if
    curFiles.length is equal to 0. If so, print a message into the
    preview <div> stating that no files have been selected.
-   If files have been selected, we loop through each one, printing
    information about it into the preview <div>. Things to note here:
-   We use the custom validFileType() function to check whether the file
    is of the correct type (e.g. the image types specified in the accept
    attribute).
-   If it is, we:
    -   Print out its name and file size into a list item inside the
        previous <div> (obtained from file.name and file.size). The
        custom returnFileSize() function returns a nicely-formatted
        version of the size in bytes/KB/MB (by default the browser
        reports the size in absolute bytes).
    -   Generate a thumbnail preview of the image by calling
        URL.createObjectURL(file). Then, insert the image into the list
        item too by creating a new <img> and setting its src to the
        thumbnail.
-   If the file type is invalid, we display a message inside a list item
    telling the user that they need to select a different file type.

js

    function updateImageDisplay() {
      while (preview.firstChild) {
        preview.removeChild(preview.firstChild);
      }

      const curFiles = input.files;
      if (curFiles.length === 0) {
        const para = document.createElement("p");
        para.textContent = "No files currently selected for upload";
        preview.appendChild(para);
      } else {
        const list = document.createElement("ol");
        preview.appendChild(list);

        for (const file of curFiles) {
          const listItem = document.createElement("li");
          const para = document.createElement("p");
          if (validFileType(file)) {
            para.textContent = `File name ${file.name}, file size ${returnFileSize(
              file.size,
            )}.`;
            const image = document.createElement("img");
            image.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);
            image.alt = image.title = file.name;

            listItem.appendChild(image);
            listItem.appendChild(para);
          } else {
            para.textContent = `File name ${file.name}: Not a valid file type. Update your selection.`;
            listItem.appendChild(para);
          }

          list.appendChild(listItem);
        }
      }
    }

The custom validFileType() function takes a File object as a parameter,
then uses Array.prototype.includes() to check if any value in the
fileTypes matches the file's type property. If a match is found, the
function returns true. If no match is found, it returns false.

js

    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types
    const fileTypes = [
      "image/apng",
      "image/bmp",
      "image/gif",
      "image/jpeg",
      "image/pjpeg",
      "image/png",
      "image/svg+xml",
      "image/tiff",
      "image/webp",
      "image/x-icon",
    ];

    function validFileType(file) {
      return fileTypes.includes(file.type);
    }

The returnFileSize() function takes a number (of bytes, taken from the
current file's size property), and turns it into a nicely formatted size
in bytes/KB/MB.

js

    function returnFileSize(number) {
      if (number < 1024) {
        return `${number} bytes`;
      } else if (number >= 1024 && number < 1048576) {
        return `${(number / 1024).toFixed(1)} KB`;
      } else if (number >= 1048576) {
        return `${(number / 1048576).toFixed(1)} MB`;
      }
    }

    const button = document.querySelector("form button");
    button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      const para = document.createElement("p");
      para.append("Image uploaded!");
      preview.replaceChildren(para);
    });

The example looks like this; have a play:

# <input type="hidden">#

<input> elements of type hidden let web developers include data that
cannot be seen or modified by users when a form is submitted. For
example, the ID of the content that is currently being ordered or
edited, or a unique security token. Hidden inputs are completely
invisible in the rendered page, and there is no way to make it visible
in the page's content.

Note: The input and change events do not apply to this input type.
Hidden inputs cannot be focused even using JavaScript (e.g.
hiddenInput.focus()).

Value

The <input> element's value attribute holds a string that contains the
hidden data you want to include when the form is submitted to the
server. This specifically can't be edited or seen by the user via the
user interface, although you could edit the value via browser developer
tools.

Warning: While the value isn't displayed to the user in the page's
content, it is visible—and can be edited—using any browser's developer
tools or "View Source" functionality. Do not rely on hidden inputs as a
form of security.

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes common to all <input> elements, hidden
inputs offer the following attributes.

name

This is actually one of the common attributes, but it has a special
meaning available for hidden inputs. Normally, the name attribute
functions on hidden inputs just like on any other input. However, when
the form is submitted, a hidden input whose name is set to _charset_
will automatically be reported with the value set to the character
encoding used to submit the form.

Using hidden inputs

As mentioned above, hidden inputs can be used anywhere that you want to
include data the user can't see or edit along with the form when it's
submitted to the server. Let's look at some examples that illustrate its
use.

Tracking edited content

One of the most common uses for hidden inputs is to keep track of what
database record needs to be updated when an edit form is submitted. A
typical workflow looks like this:

1.  User decides to edit some content they have control over, such as a
    blog post, or a product entry. They get started by pressing the edit
    button.
2.  The content to be edited is taken from the database and loaded into
    an HTML form to allow the user to make changes.
3.  After editing, the user submits the form, and the updated data is
    sent back to the server to be updated in the database.

The idea here is that during step 2, the ID of the record being updated
is kept in a hidden input. When the form is submitted in step 3, the ID
is automatically sent back to the server with the record content. The ID
lets the site's server-side component know exactly which record needs to
be updated with the submitted data.

You can see a full example of what this might look like in the Examples
section below.

Improving website security

Hidden inputs are also used to store and submit security tokens or
secrets, for the purposes of improving website security. The basic idea
is that if a user is filling in a sensitive form, such as a form on
their banking website to transfer some money to another account, the
secret they would be provided with would prove that they are who they
say they are, and that they are using the correct form to submit the
transfer request.

This would stop a malicious user from creating a fake form, pretending
to be a bank, and emailing the form to unsuspecting users to trick them
into transferring money to the wrong place. This kind of attack is
called a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF); pretty much any reputable
server-side framework uses hidden secrets to prevent such attacks.

Note: Placing the secret in a hidden input doesn't inherently make it
secure. The key's composition and encoding would do that. The value of
the hidden input is that it keeps the secret associated with the data
and automatically includes it when the form is sent to the server. You
need to use well-designed secrets to actually secure your website.

Validation

Hidden inputs don't participate in constraint validation; they have no
real value to be constrained.

Examples

Let's look at how we might implement a simple version of the edit form
we described earlier (see Tracking edited content), using a hidden input
to remember the ID of the record being edited.

The edit form's HTML might look a bit like this:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="title">Post title:</label>
        <input type="text" id="title" name="title" value="My excellent blog post" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="content">Post content:</label>
        <textarea id="content" name="content" cols="60" rows="5">
    This is the content of my excellent blog post. I hope you enjoy it!
        </textarea>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button type="submit">Update post</button>
      </div>
      <input type="hidden" id="postId" name="postId" value="34657" />
    </form>

Let's also add some simple CSS:

css

    html {
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }

    form {
      width: 500px;
    }

    div {
      display: flex;
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

    label {
      flex: 2;
      line-height: 2;
      text-align: right;
      padding-right: 20px;
    }

    input,
    textarea {
      flex: 7;
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 1.1rem;
      padding: 5px;
    }

    textarea {
      height: 60px;
    }

The server would set the value of the hidden input with the ID "postID"
to the ID of the post in its database before sending the form to the
user's browser and would use that information when the form is returned
to know which database record to update with modified information. No
scripting is needed in the content to handle this.

The output looks like this:

Note: You can also find the example on GitHub (see the source code, and
also see it running live).

When submitted, the form data sent to the server will look something
like this:

title=My+excellent+blog+post&content=This+is+the+content+of+my+excellent+blog+post.+I+hope+you+enjoy+it!&postId=34657

Even though the hidden input cannot be seen at all, its data is still
submitted.

# <input>: The Input (Form Input) element#

The <input> HTML element is used to create interactive controls for
web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of
types of input data and control widgets are available, depending on the
device and user agent. The <input> element is one of the most powerful
and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number of combinations of
input types and attributes.

<input> types

How an <input> works varies considerably depending on the value of its
type attribute, hence the different types are covered in their own
separate reference pages. If this attribute is not specified, the
default type adopted is text.

The available types are as follows:

+---+-----------------------------------+---+
| T | Description                       | B |
| y |                                   | a |

Attributes

The <input> element is so powerful because of its attributes; the type
attribute, described with examples above, being the most important.
Since every <input> element, regardless of type, is based on the
HTMLInputElement interface, they technically share the exact same set of
attributes. However, in reality, most attributes have an effect on only
a specific subset of input types. In addition, the way some attributes
impact an input depends on the input type, impacting different input
types in different ways.

This section provides a table listing all the attributes with a brief
description. This table is followed by a list describing each attribute
in greater detail, along with which input types they are associated
with. Those that are common to most or all input types are defined in
greater detail below. Attributes that are unique to particular input
types—or attributes which are common to all input types but have special
behaviors when used on a given input type—are instead documented on
those types' pages.

Attributes for the <input> element include the global HTML attributes
and additionally:

A few additional non-standard attributes are listed following the
descriptions of the standard attributes.

Individual attributes

accept

    Valid for the file input type only, the accept attribute defines
    which file types are selectable in a file upload control. See the
    file input type.

alt

    Valid for the image button only, the alt attribute provides
    alternative text for the image, displaying the value of the
    attribute if the image src is missing or otherwise fails to load.
    See the image input type.

autocapitalize

    Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if
    so, in what manner. See the autocapitalize global attribute page for
    more information.

autocomplete

    (Not a Boolean attribute!) The autocomplete attribute takes as its
    value a space-separated string that describes what, if any, type of
    autocomplete functionality the input should provide. A typical
    implementation of autocomplete recalls previous values entered in
    the same input field, but more complex forms of autocomplete can
    exist. For instance, a browser could integrate with a device's
    contacts list to autocomplete email addresses in an email input
    field. See autocomplete for permitted values.

    The autocomplete attribute is valid on hidden, text, search, url,
    tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range,
    color, and password. This attribute has no effect on input types
    that do not return numeric or text data, being valid for all input
    types except checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types.

    See the autocomplete attribute for additional information, including
    information on password security and how autocomplete is slightly
    different for hidden than for other input types.

autofocus

    A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the input
    should automatically have focus when the page has finished loading
    (or when the <dialog> containing the element has been displayed).

    Note: An element with the autofocus attribute may gain focus before
    the DOMContentLoaded event is fired.

    No more than one element in the document may have the autofocus
    attribute. If put on more than one element, the first one with the
    attribute receives focus.

    The autofocus attribute cannot be used on inputs of type hidden,
    since hidden inputs cannot be focused.

    Warning: Automatically focusing a form control can confuse
    visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people
    with cognitive impairments. When autofocus is assigned,
    screen-readers "teleport" their user to the form control without
    warning them beforehand.

    Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the
    autofocus attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause
    the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic
    keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader
    will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the
    screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the
    sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created
    by the preceding content.

capture

    Introduced in the HTML Media Capture specification and valid for the
    file input type only, the capture attribute defines which
    media—microphone, video, or camera—should be used to capture a new
    file for upload with file upload control in supporting scenarios.
    See the file input type.

checked

    Valid for both radio and checkbox types, checked is a Boolean
    attribute. If present on a radio type, it indicates that the radio
    button is the currently selected one in the group of same-named
    radio buttons. If present on a checkbox type, it indicates that the
    checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does not
    indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the
    checkbox's state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect
    the change. (Only the HTMLInputElement's checked IDL attribute is
    updated.)

    Note: Unlike other input controls, a checkboxes and radio buttons
    value are only included in the submitted data if they are currently
    checked. If they are, the name and the value(s) of the checked
    controls are submitted.

    For example, if a checkbox whose name is fruit has a value of
    cherry, and the checkbox is checked, the form data submitted will
    include fruit=cherry. If the checkbox isn't active, it isn't listed
    in the form data at all. The default value for checkboxes and radio
    buttons is on.

dirname

    Valid for hidden, text, search, url, tel, and email input types, the
    dirname attribute enables the submission of the directionality of
    the element. When included, the form control will submit with two
    name/value pairs: the first being the name and value, and the second
    being the value of the dirname attribute as the name, with a value
    of ltr or rtl as set by the browser.

    html

        <form action="page.html" method="post">
          <label>
            Fruit:
            <input type="text" name="fruit" dirname="fruit-dir" value="cherry" />
          </label>
          <input type="submit" />
        </form>
        <!-- page.html?fruit=cherry&fruit-dir=ltr -->

    When the form above is submitted, the input cause both the name /
    value pair of fruit=cherry and the dirname / direction pair of
    fruit-dir=ltr to be sent. For more information, see the dirname
    attribute.

disabled

    A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user
    should not be able to interact with the input. Disabled inputs are
    typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of
    indication that the field is not available for use.

    Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the click event, and
    disabled inputs are not submitted with the form.

    Note: Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by
    default persist the dynamic disabled state of an <input> across page
    loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature.

form

    A string specifying the <form> element with which the input is
    associated (that is, its form owner). This string's value, if
    present, must match the id of a <form> element in the same document.
    If this attribute isn't specified, the <input> element is associated
    with the nearest containing form, if any.

    The form attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document
    but have it included with a form elsewhere in the document.

    Note: An input can only be associated with one form.

formaction

    Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit
    input type for more information.

formenctype

    Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit
    input type for more information.

formmethod

    Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit
    input type for more information.

formnovalidate

    Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit
    input type for more information.

formtarget

    Valid for the image and submit input types only. See the submit
    input type for more information.

height

    Valid for the image input button only, the height is the height of
    the image file to display to represent the graphical submit button.
    See the image input type.

id

    Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input
    types, it defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in
    the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when
    linking. The value is used as the value of the <label>'s for
    attribute to link the label with the form control. See <label>.

inputmode

    Global value valid for all elements, it provides a hint to browsers
    as to the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use when editing
    this element or its contents. Values include none, text, tel, url,
    email, numeric, decimal, and search.

list

    The value given to the list attribute should be the id of a
    <datalist> element located in the same document. The <datalist>
    provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this
    input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the type
    are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are
    suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined
    list or provide a different value.

    It is valid on text, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week,
    time, datetime-local, number, range, and color.

    Per the specifications, the list attribute is not supported by the
    hidden, password, checkbox, radio, file, or any of the button types.

    Depending on the browser, the user may see a custom color palette
    suggested, tic marks along a range, or even an input that opens like
    a <select> but allows for non-listed values. Check out the browser
    compatibility table for the other input types.

    See the <datalist> element.

max

    Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and
    range, it defines the greatest value in the range of permitted
    values. If the value entered into the element exceeds this, the
    element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max
    attribute isn't a number, then the element has no maximum value.

    There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for
    dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of
    min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example,
    this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM.

maxlength

    Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines
    the maximum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the
    user can enter into the field. This must be an integer value of 0 or
    higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is
    specified, the field has no maximum length. This value must also be
    greater than or equal to the value of minlength.

    The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
    entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units
    long. By default, browsers prevent users from entering more
    characters than allowed by the maxlength attribute. See Client-side
    validation for more information.

min

    Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and
    range, it defines the most negative value in the range of permitted
    values. If the value entered into the element is less than this, the
    element fails constraint validation. If the value of the min
    attribute isn't a number, then the element has no minimum value.

    This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max
    attribute. If the min attribute is present but is not specified or
    is invalid, no min value is applied. If the min attribute is valid
    and a non-empty value is less than the minimum allowed by the min
    attribute, constraint validation will prevent form submission. See
    Client-side validation for more information.

    There is a special case: if the data type is periodic (such as for
    dates or times), the value of max may be lower than the value of
    min, which indicates that the range may wrap around; for example,
    this allows you to specify a time range from 10 PM to 4 AM.

minlength

    Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, it defines
    the minimum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the
    user can enter into the entry field. This must be a non-negative
    integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by
    maxlength. If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is
    specified, the input has no minimum length.

    The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
    entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units
    long, preventing form submission. See Client-side validation for
    more information.

multiple

    The Boolean multiple attribute, if set, means the user can enter
    comma separated email addresses in the email widget or can choose
    more than one file with the file input. See the email and file input
    type.

name

    A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is
    submitted along with the control's value when the form data is
    submitted.

    Consider the name a required attribute (even though it's not). If an
    input has no name specified, or name is empty, the input's value is
    not submitted with the form! (Disabled controls, unchecked radio
    buttons, unchecked checkboxes, and reset buttons are also not sent.)

    There are two special cases:

    1.  _charset_ : If used as the name of an <input> element of type
        hidden, the input's value is automatically set by the user agent
        to the character encoding being used to submit the form.
    2.  isindex: For historical reasons, the name isindex is not
        allowed.

    The name attribute creates a unique behavior for radio buttons.

    Only one radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons can be
    checked at a time. Selecting any radio button in that group
    automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the
    same group. The value of that one checked radio button is sent along
    with the name if the form is submitted,

    When tabbing into a series of same-named group of radio buttons, if
    one is checked, that one will receive focus. If they aren't grouped
    together in source order, if one of the group is checked, tabbing
    into the group starts when the first one in the group is
    encountered, skipping all those that aren't checked. In other words,
    if one is checked, tabbing skips the unchecked radio buttons in the
    group. If none are checked, the radio button group receives focus
    when the first button in the same name group is reached.

    Once one of the radio buttons in a group has focus, using the arrow
    keys will navigate through all the radio buttons of the same name,
    even if the radio buttons are not grouped together in the source
    order.

    When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property
    of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. If
    you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name
    is hat-size, the following code can be used:

    js

        let form = document.querySelector("form");

        let guestName = form.elements.guest;
        let hatSize = form.elements["hat-size"];

    When this code has run, guestName will be the HTMLInputElement for
    the guest field, and hatSize the object for the hat-size field.

    Warning: Avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a
    built-in property of the form, since you would then override the
    predefined property or method with this reference to the
    corresponding input.

pattern

    Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, and password, the pattern
    attribute defines a regular expression that the input's value must
    match in order for the value to pass constraint validation. It must
    be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp
    type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u'
    flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the
    pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of
    as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern
    text.

    If the pattern attribute is present but is not specified or is
    invalid, no regular expression is applied and this attribute is
    ignored completely. If the pattern attribute is valid and a
    non-empty value does not match the pattern, constraint validation
    will prevent form submission.

    Note: If using the pattern attribute, inform the user about the
    expected format by including explanatory text nearby. You can also
    include a title attribute to explain what the requirements are to
    match the pattern; most browsers will display this title as a
    tooltip. The visible explanation is required for accessibility. The
    tooltip is an enhancement.

    See Client-side validation for more information.

placeholder

    Valid for text, search, url, tel, email, password, and number, the
    placeholder attribute provides a brief hint to the user as to what
    kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or
    short phrase that provides a hint as to the expected type of data,
    rather than an explanation or prompt. The text must not include
    carriage returns or line feeds. So for example if a field is
    expected to capture a user's first name, and its label is "First
    Name", a suitable placeholder might be "e.g. Mustafa".

    Note: The placeholder attribute is not as semantically useful as
    other ways to explain your form, and can cause unexpected technical
    issues with your content. See Labels for more information.

popovertarget

    Turns an <input type="button"> element into a popover control
    button; takes the ID of the popover element to control as its value.
    See the Popover API landing page for more details.

popovertargetaction

    Specifies the action to be performed on a popover element being
    controlled by a control <input type="button">. Possible values are:

    "hide"

        The button will hide a shown popover. If you try to hide an
        already hidden popover, no action will be taken.

    "show"

        The button will show a hidden popover. If you try to show an
        already showing popover, no action will be taken.

    "toggle"

        The button will toggle a popover between showing and hidden. If
        the popover is hidden, it will be shown; if the popover is
        showing, it will be hidden. If popovertargetaction is omitted,
        "toggle" is the default action that will be performed by the
        control button.

readonly

    A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user
    should not be able to edit the value of the input. The readonly
    attribute is supported by the text, search, url, tel, email, date,
    month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and password input types.

    See the HTML attribute: readonly for more information.

required

    required is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that
    the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form
    can be submitted. The required attribute is supported by text,
    search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local,
    number, password, checkbox, radio, and file inputs.

    See Client-side validation and the HTML attribute: required for more
    information.

size

    Valid for email, password, tel, url, and text, the size attribute
    specifies how much of the input is shown. Basically creates same
    result as setting CSS width property with a few specialities. The
    actual unit of the value depends on the input type. For password and
    text, it is a number of characters (or em units) with a default
    value of 20, and for others, it is pixels (or px units). CSS width
    takes precedence over the size attribute.

src

    Valid for the image input button only, the src is string specifying
    the URL of the image file to display to represent the graphical
    submit button. See the image input type.

step

    Valid for date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, and
    range, the step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity
    that the value must adhere to.

    If not explicitly included:

    -   step defaults to 1 for number and range.
    -   Each date/time input type has a default step value appropriate
        for the type; see the individual input pages: date,
        datetime-local, month, time, and week.

    The value must be a positive number—integer or float—or the special
    value any, which means no stepping is implied, and any value is
    allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max).

    If any is not explicitly set, valid values for the number, date/time
    input types, and range input types are equal to the basis for
    stepping — the min value and increments of the step value, up to the
    max value, if specified.

    For example, if you have <input type="number" min="10" step="2">,
    then any even integer, 10 or greater, is valid. If omitted,
    <input type="number">, any integer is valid, but floats (like 4.2)
    are not valid, because step defaults to 1. For 4.2 to be valid, step
    would have had to be set to any, 0.1, 0.2, or any the min value
    would have had to be a number ending in .2, such as
    <input type="number" min="-5.2">

    Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the
    stepping configuration, the value is considered invalid in
    constraint validation and will match the :invalid pseudoclass.

    See Client-side validation for more information.

tabindex

    Global attribute valid for all elements, including all the input
    types, an integer attribute indicating if the element can take input
    focus (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential
    keyboard navigation. As all input types except for input of type
    hidden are focusable, this attribute should not be used on form
    controls, because doing so would require the management of the focus
    order for all elements within the document with the risk of harming
    usability and accessibility if done incorrectly.

title

    Global attribute valid for all elements, including all input types,
    containing a text representing advisory information related to the
    element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not
    necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip. The title should
    NOT be used as the primary explanation of the purpose of the form
    control. Instead, use the <label> element with a for attribute set
    to the form control's id attribute. See Labels below.

type

    A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to
    create a checkbox, a value of checkbox is used. If omitted (or an
    unknown value is specified), the input type text is used, creating a
    plaintext input field.

    Permitted values are listed in Input types above.

value

    The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the
    initial value, and from then on it can be altered or retrieved at
    any time using JavaScript to access the respective HTMLInputElement
    object's value property. The value attribute is always optional,
    though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and
    hidden.

width

    Valid for the image input button only, the width is the width of the
    image file to display to represent the graphical submit button. See
    the image input type.

Non-standard attributes

The following non-standard attributes are also available on some
browsers. As a general rule, you should avoid using them unless it can't
be helped.

  Attribute                  Description
  -------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  autocorrect                A string indicating whether autocorrect is on or off. Safari only.
  incremental                Whether or not to send repeated search events to allow updating live search results while the user is still editing the value of the field. WebKit and Blink only (Safari, Chrome, Opera, etc.).
  mozactionhint Deprecated   A string indicating the type of action that will be taken when the user presses the Enter or Return key while editing the field; this is used to determine an appropriate label for that key on a virtual keyboard. Since this attribute is deprecated, use enterkeyhint instead.
  orient                     Sets the orientation of the range slider. Firefox only.
  results                    The maximum number of items that should be displayed in the drop-down list of previous search queries. Safari only.
  webkitdirectory            A Boolean indicating whether to only allow the user to choose a directory (or directories, if multiple is also present)

autocorrect Non-standard

    (Safari only). A string which indicates whether to activate
    automatic correction while the user is editing this field. Permitted
    values are:

    on

        Enable automatic correction of typos, as well as processing of
        text substitutions if any are configured.

    off

        Disable automatic correction and text substitutions.

incremental Non-standard

    The Boolean attribute incremental is a WebKit and Blink extension
    (so supported by Safari, Opera, Chrome, etc.) which, if present,
    tells the user agent to process the input as a live search. As the
    user edits the value of the field, the user agent sends search
    events to the HTMLInputElement object representing the search box.
    This allows your code to update the search results in real time as
    the user edits the search.

    If incremental is not specified, the search event is only sent when
    the user explicitly initiates a search (such as by pressing the
    Enter or Return key while editing the field).

    The search event is rate-limited so that it is not sent more
    frequently than an implementation-defined interval.

orient Non-standard

    Similar to the -moz-orient non-standard CSS property impacting the
    <progress> and <meter> elements, the orient attribute defines the
    orientation of the range slider. Values include horizontal, meaning
    the range is rendered horizontally, and vertical, where the range is
    rendered vertically.

results Non-standard

    The results attribute—supported only by Safari—is a numeric value
    that lets you override the maximum number of entries to be displayed
    in the <input> element's natively-provided drop-down menu of
    previous search queries.

    The value must be a non-negative decimal number. If not provided, or
    an invalid value is given, the browser's default maximum number of
    entries is used.

webkitdirectory Non-standard

    The Boolean webkitdirectory attribute, if present, indicates that
    only directories should be available to be selected by the user in
    the file picker interface. See HTMLInputElement.webkitdirectory for
    additional details and examples.

    Though originally implemented only for WebKit-based browsers,
    webkitdirectory is also usable in Microsoft Edge as well as Firefox
    50 and later. However, even though it has relatively broad support,
    it is still not standard and should not be used unless you have no
    alternative.

Methods

The following methods are provided by the HTMLInputElement interface
which represents <input> elements in the DOM. Also available are those
methods specified by the parent interfaces, HTMLElement, Element, Node,
and EventTarget.

checkValidity()

    Returns true if the element's value passes validity checks;
    otherwise, returns false and fires an invalid event at the element.

reportValidity()

    Returns true if the element's value passes validity checks;
    otherwise, returns false, fires an invalid event at the element, and
    (if the event isn't canceled) reports the problem to the user.

select()

    Selects the entire content of the <input> element, if the element's
    content is selectable. For elements with no selectable text content
    (such as a visual color picker or calendar date input), this method
    does nothing.

setCustomValidity()

    Sets a custom message to display if the input element's value isn't
    valid.

setRangeText()

    Sets the contents of the specified range of characters in the input
    element to a given string. A selectMode parameter is available to
    allow controlling how the existing content is affected.

setSelectionRange()

    Selects the specified range of characters within a textual input
    element. Does nothing for inputs which aren't presented as text
    input fields.

showPicker()

    Displays the browser picker for the input element that would
    normally be displayed when the element is selected, but triggered
    from a button press or other user interaction.

stepDown()

    Decrements the value of a numeric input by one, by default, or by
    the specified number of units.

stepUp()

    Increments the value of a numeric input by one or by the specified
    number of units.

CSS

Inputs, being replaced elements, have a few features not applicable to
non form elements. There are CSS selectors that can specifically target
form controls based on their UI features, also known as UI
pseudo-classes. The input element can also be targeted by type with
attribute selectors. There are some properties that are especially
useful as well.

UI pseudo-classes

  Pseudo-class         Description
  -------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  :enabled             Any currently enabled element that can be activated (selected, clicked on, typed into, etc.) or accept focus and also has a disabled state, in which it can't be activated or accept focus.
  :disabled            Any currently disabled element that has an enabled state, meaning it otherwise could be activated (selected, clicked on, typed into, etc.) or accept focus were it not disabled.
  :read-only           Element not editable by the user
  :read-write          Element that is editable by the user.
  :placeholder-shown   Element that is currently displaying placeholder text, including <input> and <textarea> elements with the placeholder attribute present that has, as yet, no value.
  :default             Form elements that are the default in a group of related elements. Matches checkbox and radio input types that were checked on page load or render.
  :checked             Matches checkbox and radio input types that are currently checked (and the (<option> in a <select> that is currently selected).
  :indeterminate       checkbox elements whose indeterminate property is set to true by JavaScript, radio elements, when all radio buttons with the same name value in the form are unchecked, and <progress> elements in an indeterminate state
  :valid               Form controls that can have constraint validation applied and are currently valid.
  :invalid             Form controls that have constraint validation applied and are currently not valid. Matches a form control whose value doesn't match the constraints set on it by its attributes, such as required, pattern, step and max.
  :in-range            A non-empty input whose current value is within the range limits specified by the min and max attributes and the step.
  :out-of-range        A non-empty input whose current value is NOT within the range limits specified by the min and max attributes or does not adhere to the step constraint.
  :required            <input>, <select>, or <textarea> element that has the required attribute set on it. Only matches elements that can be required. The attribute included on a non-requirable element will not make for a match.
  :optional            <input>, <select>, or <textarea> element that does NOT have the required attribute set on it. Does not match elements that can't be required.
  :blank               <input> and <textarea> elements that currently have no value.
  :user-invalid        Similar to :invalid, but is activated on blur. Matches invalid input but only after the user interaction, such as by focusing on the control, leaving the control, or attempting to submit the form containing the invalid control.

  : Captions super relevant to the <input> element:

Pseudo-classes example

We can style a checkbox label based on whether the checkbox is checked
or not. In this example, we are styling the color and font-weight of the
<label> that comes immediately after a checked input. We haven't applied
any styles if the input is not checked.

    <input id="checkboxInput" type="checkbox" />
    <label for="checkboxInput">Toggle the checkbox on and off</label>

css

    input:checked + label {
      color: red;
      font-weight: bold;
    }

Attribute selectors

It is possible to target different types of form controls based on their
type using attribute selectors. CSS attribute selectors match elements
based on either just the presence of an attribute or the value of a
given attribute.

css

    /* matches a password input */
    input[type="password"] {
    }

    /* matches a form control whose valid values are limited to a range of values*/
    input[min][max] {
    }

    /* matches a form control with a pattern attribute */
    input[pattern] {
    }

::placeholder

By default, the appearance of placeholder text is a translucent or light
gray. The ::placeholder pseudo-element is the input's placeholder text.
It can be styled with a limited subset of CSS properties.

css

    ::placeholder {
      color: blue;
    }

Only the subset of CSS properties that apply to the ::first-line
pseudo-element can be used in a rule using ::placeholder in its
selector.

appearance

The appearance property enables the displaying of (almost) any element
as a platform-native style based on the operating system's theme as well
as the removal of any platform-native styling with the none value.

You could make a <div> look like a radio button with
div {appearance: radio;} or a radio look like a checkbox with
[type="radio"] {appearance: checkbox;}, but don't.

Setting appearance: none removes platform native borders, but not
functionality.

caret-color

A property specific to text entry-related elements is the CSS
caret-color property, which lets you set the color used to draw the text
input caret:

HTML

html

    <label for="textInput">Note the red caret:</label>
    <input id="textInput" class="custom" size="32" />

CSS

css

    input.custom {
      caret-color: red;
      font:
        16px "Helvetica",
        "Arial",
        "sans-serif";
    }

Result

object-position and object-fit

In certain cases (typically involving non-textual inputs and specialized
interfaces), the <input> element is a replaced element. When it is, the
position and size of the element's size and positioning within its frame
can be adjusted using the CSS object-position and object-fit properties

-   Advanced styling for HTML forms and
-   the compatibility table of CSS properties.

Additional features

Labels

Labels are needed to associate assistive text with an <input>. The
<label> element provides explanatory information about a form field that
is always appropriate (aside from any layout concerns you have). It's
never a bad idea to use a <label> to explain what should be entered into
an <input> or <textarea>.

Associated labels

The semantic pairing of <input> and <label> elements is useful for
assistive technologies such as screen readers. By pairing them using the
<label>'s for attribute, you bond the label to the input in a way that
lets screen readers describe inputs to users more precisely.

It does not suffice to have plain text adjacent to the <input> element.
Rather, usability and accessibility requires the inclusion of either
implicit or explicit <label>:

html

    <!-- inaccessible -->
    <p>Enter your name: <input id="name" type="text" size="30" /></p>

    <!-- implicit label -->
    <p>
      <label>Enter your name: <input id="name" type="text" size="30" /></label>
    </p>

    <!-- explicit label -->
    <p>
      <label for="name">Enter your name: </label>
      <input id="name" type="text" size="30" />
    </p>

The first example is inaccessible: no relationship exists between the
prompt and the <input> element.

In addition to an accessible name, the label provides a larger 'hit'
area for mouse and touch screen users to click on or touch. By pairing a
<label> with an <input>, clicking on either one will focus the <input>.
If you use plain text to "label" your input, this won't happen. Having
the prompt part of the activation area for the input is helpful for
people with motor control conditions.

As web developers, it's important that we never assume that people will
know all the things that we know. The diversity of people using the
web—and by extension your website—practically guarantees that some of
your site's visitors will have some variation in thought processes
and/or circumstances that leads them to interpret your forms very
differently from you without clear and properly-presented labels.

Placeholders are not accessible

The placeholder attribute lets you specify text that appears within the
<input> element's content area itself when it is empty. The placeholder
should never be required to understand your forms. It is not a label,
and should not be used as a substitute, because it isn't. The
placeholder is used to provide a hint as to what an inputted value
should look like, not an explanation or prompt.

Not only is the placeholder not accessible to screen readers, but once
the user enters any text into the form control, or if the form control
already has a value, the placeholder disappears. Browsers with automatic
page translation features may skip over attributes when translating,
meaning the placeholder may not get translated.

Note: Don't use the placeholder attribute if you can avoid it. If you
need to label an <input> element, use the <label> element.

Client-side validation

Warning: Client-side validation is useful, but it does not guarantee
that the server will receive valid data. If the data must be in a
specific format, always verify it also on the server-side, and return a
400 HTTP response if the format is invalid.

In addition to using CSS to style inputs based on the :valid or :invalid
UI states based on the current state of each input, as noted in the UI
pseudo-classes section above, the browser provides for client-side
validation on (attempted) form submission. On form submission, if there
is a form control that fails constraint validation, supporting browsers
will display an error message on the first invalid form control;
displaying a default message based on the error type, or a message set
by you.

Some input types and other attributes place limits on what values are
valid for a given input. For example,
<input type="number" min="2" max="10" step="2"> means only the number 2,
4, 6, 8, or 10 are valid. Several errors could occur, including a
rangeUnderflow error if the value is less than 2, rangeOverflow if
greater than 10, stepMismatch if the value is a number between 2 and 10,
but not an even integer (does not match the requirements of the step
attribute), or typeMismatch if the value is not a number.

For the input types whose domain of possible values is periodic (that
is, at the highest possible value, the values wrap back around to the
beginning rather than ending), it's possible for the values of the max
and min properties to be reversed, which indicates that the range of
permitted values starts at min, wraps around to the lowest possible
value, then continues on until max is reached. This is particularly
useful for dates and times, such as when you want to allow the range to

Specific attributes and their values can lead to a specific error
ValidityState:

  Attribute   Relevant property               Description
  ----------- ------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  max         validityState.rangeOverflow     Occurs when the value is greater than the maximum value as defined by the max attribute
  maxlength   validityState.tooLong           Occurs when the number of characters is greater than the number allowed by the maxlength property
  min         validityState.rangeUnderflow    Occurs when the value is less than the minimum value as defined by the min attribute
  minlength   validityState.tooShort          Occurs when the number of characters is less than the number required by the minlength property
  pattern     validityState.patternMismatch   Occurs when a pattern attribute is included with a valid regular expression and the value does not match it.
  required    validityState.valueMissing      Occurs when the required attribute is present but the value is null or radio or checkbox is not checked.
  step        validityState.stepMismatch      The value doesn't match the step increment. Increment default is 1, so only integers are valid on type="number" is step is not included. step="any" will never throw this error.
  type        validityState.typeMismatch      Occurs when the value is not of the correct type, for example an email does not contain an @ or a url doesn't contain a protocol.

  : Validity object errors depend on the <input> attributes and their
  values:

If a form control doesn't have the required attribute, no value, or an
empty string, is not invalid. Even if the above attributes are present,
with the exception of required, an empty string will not lead to an
error.

We can set limits on what values we accept, and supporting browsers will
natively validate these form values and alert the user if there is a
mistake when the form is submitted.

In addition to the errors described in the table above, the
validityState interface contains the badInput, valid, and customError
boolean readonly properties. The validity object includes:

-   validityState.valueMissing
-   validityState.typeMismatch
-   validityState.patternMismatch
-   validityState.tooLong
-   validityState.tooShort
-   validityState.rangeUnderflow
-   validityState.rangeOverflow
-   validityState.stepMismatch
-   validityState.badInput
-   validityState.valid
-   validityState.customError

For each of these Boolean properties, a value of true indicates that the
specified reason validation may have failed is true, with the exception
of the valid property, which is true if the element's value obeys all
constraints.

If there is an error, supporting browsers will both alert the user and
prevent the form from being submitted. A word of caution: if a custom
error is set to a truthy value (anything other than the empty string or
null), the form will be prevented from being submitted. If there is no
custom error message, and none of the other properties return true,
valid will be true, and the form can be submitted.

js

    function validate(input) {
      let validityState_object = input.validity;
      if (validityState_object.valueMissing) {
        input.setCustomValidity("A value is required");
      } else if (validityState_object.rangeUnderflow) {
        input.setCustomValidity("Your value is too low");
      } else if (validityState_object.rangeOverflow) {
        input.setCustomValidity("Your value is too high");
      } else {
        input.setCustomValidity("");
      }
    }

The last line, setting the custom validity message to the empty string
is vital. If the user makes an error, and the validity is set, it will
fail to submit, even if all the values are valid, until the message is
null.

Custom validation error example

If you want to present a custom error message when a field fails to
validate, you need to use the Constraint Validation API available on
<input> (and related) elements. Take the following form:

html

    <form>
      <label for="name">Enter username (upper and lowercase letters): </label>
      <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required pattern="[A-Za-z]+" />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>

The basic HTML form validation features will cause this to produce a
default error message if you try to submit the form with either no valid
filled in, or a value that does not match the pattern.

If you wanted to instead display custom error messages, you could use
JavaScript like the following:

js

    const nameInput = document.querySelector("input");

    nameInput.addEventListener("input", () => {
      nameInput.setCustomValidity("");
      nameInput.checkValidity();
    });

    nameInput.addEventListener("invalid", () => {
      if (nameInput.value === "") {
        nameInput.setCustomValidity("Enter your username!");
      } else {
        nameInput.setCustomValidity(
          "Usernames can only contain upper and lowercase letters. Try again!",
        );
      }
    });

The example renders like so:

In brief:

-   We check the valid state of the input element every time its value
    is changed by running the checkValidity() method via the input event
    handler.
-   If the value is invalid, an invalid event is raised, and the invalid
    event handler function is run. Inside this function we work out
    whether the value is invalid because it is empty, or because it
    doesn't match the pattern, using an if () block, and set a custom
    validity error message.
-   As a result, if the input value is invalid when the submit button is
    pressed, one of the custom error messages will be shown.
-   If it is valid, it will submit as you'd expect. For this to happen,
    the custom validity has to be cancelled, by invoking
    setCustomValidity() with an empty string value. We therefore do this
    every time the input event is raised. If you don't do this, and a
    custom validity was previously set, the input will register as
    invalid, even if it currently contains a valid value on submission.

Note: Always validate input constraints both client side and server
side. Constraint validation doesn't remove the need for validation on
the server side. Invalid values can still be sent by older browsers or
by bad actors.

Note: Firefox supported a proprietary error attribute —
x-moz-errormessage — for many versions, which allowed you set custom
error messages in a similar way. This has been removed as of version 66
(see Firefox bug 1513890).

Localization

The allowed inputs for certain <input> types depend on the locale. In
some locales, 1,000.00 is a valid number, while in other locales the
valid way to enter this number is 1.000,00.

Firefox uses the following heuristics to determine the locale to
validate the user's input (at least for type="number"):

-   Try the language specified by a lang/xml:lang attribute on the
    element or any of its parents.
-   Try the language specified by any Content-Language HTTP header. Or,
-   If none specified, use the browser's locale.

Accessibility concerns

Labels

When including inputs, it is an accessibility requirement to add labels
alongside. This is needed so those who use assistive technologies can
tell what the input is for. Also, clicking or touching a label gives
focus to the label's associated form control. This improves the
accessibility and usability for sighted users, increases the area a user
can click or touch to activate the form control. This is especially
useful (and even needed) for radio buttons and checkboxes, which are
tiny. For more information about labels in general see Labels .

The following is an example of how to associate the <label> with an
<input> element in the above style. You need to give the <input> an id
attribute. The <label> then needs a for attribute whose value is the
same as the input's id.

html

    <label for="peas">Do you like peas?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="peas" id="peas" />

Size

Interactive elements such as form input should provide an area large
enough that it is easy to activate them. This helps a variety of people,
including people with motor control issues and people using non-precise
forms of input such as a stylus or fingers. A minimum interactive size
of 44×44 CSS pixels is recommended.

# <input type="image">#

<input> elements of type image are used to create graphical submit
buttons, i.e. submit buttons that take the form of an image rather than
text.

Value

<input type="image"> elements do not accept value attributes. The path
to the image to be displayed is specified in the src attribute.

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes shared by all <input> elements, image
button inputs support the following attributes.

alt

The alt attribute provides an alternate string to use as the button's
label if the image cannot be shown (due to error, a user agent that
cannot or is configured not to show images, or if the user is using a
screen reading device). If provided, it must be a non-empty string
appropriate as a label for the button.

For example, if you have a graphical button that shows an image with an
icon and/or image text "Login Now", you should also set the alt
attribute to something like Login Now.

Note: While the alt attribute is technically optional, you should always
include one to maximize the usability of your content.

Functionally, the alt attribute of the <input type="image"> element
works just like the alt attribute on <img> elements.

formaction

A string indicating the URL to which to submit the data. This takes
precedence over the action attribute on the <form> element that owns the
<input>.

This attribute is also available on <input type="submit"> and <button>
elements.

formenctype

A string that identifies the encoding method to use when submitting the
form data to the server. There are three permitted values:

application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    This, the default value, sends the form data as a string after URL
    encoding the text using an algorithm such as encodeURI().

multipart/form-data

    Uses the FormData API to manage the data, allowing for files to be
    submitted to the server. You must use this encoding type if your
    form includes any <input> elements of type file
    (<input type="file">).

text/plain

    Plain text; mostly useful only for debugging, so you can easily see
    the data that's to be submitted.

If specified, the value of the formenctype attribute overrides the
owning form's action attribute.

This attribute is also available on <input type="submit"> and <button>
elements.

formmethod

A string indicating the HTTP method to use when submitting the form's
data; this value overrides any method attribute given on the owning
form. Permitted values are:

get

    A URL is constructed by starting with the URL given by the
    formaction or action attribute, appending a question mark ("?")
    character, then appending the form's data, encoded as described by
    formenctype or the form's enctype attribute. This URL is then sent
    to the server using an HTTP get request. This method works well for
    simple forms that contain only ASCII characters and have no side
    effects. This is the default value.

post

    The form's data is included in the body of the request that is sent
    to the URL given by the formaction or action attribute using an HTTP
    post request. This method supports complex data and file
    attachments.

dialog

    This method is used to indicate that the button closes the dialog
    with which the input is associated, and does not transmit the form
    data at all.

This attribute is also available on <input type="submit"> and <button>
elements.

formnovalidate

A Boolean attribute which, if present, specifies that the form should
not be validated before submission to the server. This overrides the
value of the novalidate attribute on the element's owning form.

This attribute is also available on <input type="submit"> and <button>
elements.

formtarget

A string which specifies a name or keyword that indicates where to
display the response received after submitting the form. The string must
be the name of a browsing context (that is, a tab, window, or <iframe>.
A value specified here overrides any target given by the target
attribute on the <form> that owns this input.

In addition to the actual names of tabs, windows, or inline frames,
there are a few special keywords that can be used:

_self

    Loads the response into the same browsing context as the one that
    contains the form. This will replace the current document with the
    received data. This is the default value used if none is specified.

_blank

    Loads the response into a new, unnamed, browsing context. This is
    typically a new tab in the same window as the current document, but
    may differ depending on the configuration of the user agent.

_parent

    Loads the response into the parent browsing context of the current
    one. If there is no parent context, this behaves the same as _self.

_top

    Loads the response into the top-level browsing context; this is the
    browsing context that is the topmost ancestor of the current
    context. If the current context is the topmost context, this behaves
    the same as _self.

This attribute is also available on <input type="submit"> and <button>
elements.

height

A number specifying the height, in CSS pixels, at which to draw the
image specified by the src attribute.

src

A string specifying the URL of the image file to display to represent
the graphical submit button. When the user interacts with the image, the
input is handled like any other button input.

width

A number indicating the width at which to draw the image, in CSS pixels.

Obsolete attributes

The following attribute was defined by HTML 4 for image inputs, but was
not implemented by all browsers and has since been deprecated.

usemap

If usemap is specified, it must be the name of an image map element,
<map>, that defines an image map to use with the image. This usage is
obsolete; you should switch to using the <img> element when you want to
use image maps.

Using image inputs

The <input type="image"> element is a replaced element (an element whose
content isn't generated or directly managed by the CSS layer), behaving
in much the same way as a regular <img> element, but with the
capabilities of a submit button.

Essential image input features

Let's look at a basic example that includes all the essential features
you'd need to use (These work exactly the same as they do on the <img>
element.):

html

    <input
      id="image"
      type="image"
      width="100"
      height="30"
      alt="Login"
      src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/forms/image-type-example/login.png" />

-   The src attribute is used to specify the path to the image you want
    to display in the button.
-   The alt attribute provides alt text for the image, so screen reader
    users can get a better idea of what the button is used for. It will
    also display if the image can't be shown for any reason (for example
    if the path is misspelled). If possible, use text which matches the
    label you'd use if you were using a standard submit button.
-   The width and height attributes are used to specify the width and
    height the image should be shown at, in pixels. The button is the
    same size as the image; if you need the button's hit area to be
    bigger than the image, you will need to use CSS (e.g. padding).
    Also, if you specify only one dimension, the other is automatically
    adjusted so that the image maintains its original aspect ratio.

Overriding default form behaviors

<input type="image"> elements — like regular submit buttons — can accept
a number of attributes that override the default form behavior:

formaction

    The URI of a program that processes the information submitted by the
    input element; overrides the action attribute of the element's form
    owner.

formenctype

    Specifies the type of content that is used to submit the form to the
    server. Possible values are:

    -   application/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value if the
        attribute is not specified.
    -   text/plain.

    If this attribute is specified, it overrides the enctype attribute
    of the element's form owner.

formmethod

    Specifies the HTTP method that the browser uses to submit the form.
    Possible values are:

    -   post: The data from the form is included in the body of the form
        and is sent to the server.
    -   get: The data from the form is appended to the form attribute
        URI, with a '?' as a separator, and the resulting URI is sent to
        the server. Use this method when the form has no side effects
        and contains only ASCII characters.

    If specified, this attribute overrides the method attribute of the
    element's form owner.

formnovalidate

    A Boolean attribute specifying that the form is not to be validated
    when it is submitted. If this attribute is specified, it overrides
    the novalidate attribute of the element's form owner.

formtarget

    A name or keyword indicating where to display the response that is
    received after submitting the form. This is a name of, or keyword
    for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame).
    If this attribute is specified, it overrides the target attribute of
    the element's form owner. The following keywords have special
    meanings:

    -   _self: Load the response into the same browsing context as the
        current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not
        specified.
    -   _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context.
    -   _parent: Load the response into the parent browsing context of
        the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the
        same way as _self.
    -   _top: Load the response into the top-level browsing context
        (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the
        current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this
        option behaves the same as _self.

Using the x and y data points

When you submit a form using a button created with <input type="image">,
two extra data points are submitted to the server automatically by the
browser — x and y. You can see this in action in our X Y coordinates
example.

When you click on the image to submit the form, you'll see the data
appended to the URL as parameters, for example ?x=52&y=55. If the image
input has a name attribute, then keep in mind that the specified name is
prefixed on every attribute, so if the name is position, then the
returned coordinates would be formatted in the URL as
?position.x=52&position.y=55. This, of course, applies to all other
attributes as well.

These are the X and Y coordinates of the image that the mouse clicked on
to submit the form, where (0,0) is the top-left of the image and the
default in case submission happens without a click on the image. These
can be used when the position the image was clicked on is significant,
for example you might have a map that when clicked, sends the
coordinates that were clicked to the server. The server-side code then
works out what location was clicked on, and returns information about
places nearby.

In our above example, we could write server-side code that works out
what color was clicked on by the coordinates submitted, and keeps a
tally of the favorite colors people voted for.

Adjusting the image's position and scaling algorithm

You can use the object-position property to adjust the positioning of
the image within the <input> element's frame, and the object-fit
property to control how the image's size is adjusted to fit within the
frame. This allows you to specify a frame for the image using the width
and height attributes to set aside space in the layout, then adjust
where within that space the image is located and how (or if) it is
scaled to occupy that space.

Examples

A login form

The following example shows the same button as before, but included in
the context of a typical login form.

HTML

html

    <form>
      <p>Login to your account</p>
      <div>
        <label for="userId">User ID</label>
        <input type="text" id="userId" name="userId" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="pwd">Password</label>
        <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input
          id="image"
          type="image"
          src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/forms/image-type-example/login.png"
          alt="Login"
          width="100" />
      </div>
    </form>

CSS

And now some simple CSS to make the basic elements sit more neatly:

css

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

    label {
      display: inline-block;
      width: 70px;
      text-align: right;
      padding-right: 10px;
    }

Adjusting the image position and scaling

In this example, we adapt the previous example to set aside more space
for the image and then adjust the actual image's size and positioning
using object-fit and object-position.

HTML

html

    <form>
      <p>Login to your account</p>
      <div>
        <label for="userId">User ID</label>
        <input type="text" id="userId" name="userId" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="pwd">Password</label>
        <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input
          id="image"
          type="image"
          src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/forms/image-type-example/login.png"
          alt="Login"
          width="200"
          height="100" />
      </div>
    </form>

CSS

css

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

    label {
      display: inline-block;
      width: 70px;
      text-align: right;
      padding-right: 10px;
    }

    #image {
      object-position: right top;
      object-fit: contain;
      background-color: #ddd;
    }

Here, object-position is configured to draw the image in the top-right
corner of the element, while object-fit is set to contain, which
indicates that the image should be drawn at the largest size that will
fit within the element's box without altering its aspect ratio. Note the
visible grey background of the element still visible in the area not
covered by the image.

# <input type="month">#

<input> elements of type month create input fields that let the user
enter a month and year allowing a month and year to be easily entered.
The value is a string whose value is in the format "YYYY-MM", where YYYY
is the four-digit year and MM is the month number.

The control's UI varies in general from browser to browser; at the
moment support is patchy, with only Chrome/Opera and Edge on desktop —
and most modern mobile browser versions — having usable implementations.
In browsers that don't support month inputs, the control degrades
gracefully to a simple <input type="text">, although there may be
automatic validation of the entered text to ensure it's formatted as
expected.

For those of you using a browser that doesn't support month, the
screenshot below shows what it looks like in Chrome and Opera. Clicking
the down arrow on the right-hand side brings up a date picker that lets
you select the month and year.

The Microsoft Edge month control looks like this:

[Month control on Edge browser]

Value

A string representing the value of the month and year entered into the
input, in the form YYYY-MM (four or more digit year, then a hyphen
("-"), followed by the two-digit month). The format of the month string
used by this input type is described in Month strings.

Setting a default value

You can set a default value for the input control by including a month
and year inside the value attribute, like so:

html

    <label for="bday-month">What month were you born in?</label>
    <input id="bday-month" type="month" name="bday-month" value="2001-06" />

One thing to note is that the displayed date format differs from the
actual value; most user agents display the month and year in a
locale-appropriate form, based on the set locale of the user's operating
system, whereas the date value is always formatted yyyy-MM.

When the above value is submitted to the server, for example, it will
look like bday-month=1978-06.

Setting the value using JavaScript

You can also get and set the date value in JavaScript using the
HTMLInputElement.value property, for example:

html

    <label for="bday-month">What month were you born in?</label>
    <input id="bday-month" type="month" name="bday-month" />

js

    const monthControl = document.querySelector('input[type="month"]');
    monthControl.value = "2001-06";

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes common to <input> elements, month inputs
offer the following attributes.

list

The values of the list attribute is the id of a <datalist> element
located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of
predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in
the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the
suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not
requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a
different value.

max

The latest year and month, in the string format discussed in the Value
section above, to accept. If the value entered into the element exceeds
this, the element fails constraint validation. If the value of the max
attribute isn't a valid string in "yyyy-MM" format, then the element has
no maximum value.

This value must specify a year-month pairing later than or equal to the
one specified by the min attribute.

min

The earliest year and month to accept, in the same "yyyy-MM" format
described above. If the value of the element is less than this, the
element fails constraint validation. If a value is specified for min
that isn't a valid year and month string, the input has no minimum
value.

This value must be a year-month pairing which is earlier than or equal
to the one specified by the max attribute.

readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited
by the user. Its value can, however, still be changed from JavaScript
code that directly sets the value of the HTMLInputElement.value
property.

Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not
have any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

step

The step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the
value must adhere to, or the special value any, which is described
below. Only values which are equal to the basis for stepping (min if
specified, value otherwise, and an appropriate default value if neither
of those is provided) are valid.

A string value of any means that no stepping is implied, and any value
is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max).

Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping
configuration, the user agent may round to the nearest valid value,
preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally
close options.

For month inputs, the value of step is given in months, with a scaling
factor of 1 (since the underlying numeric value is also in months). The
default value of step is 1 month.

Using month inputs

Date-related inputs (including month) sound convenient at first glance;
they promise an easy UI for choosing dates, and they normalize the data
format sent to the server, regardless of the user's locale. However,
there are issues with <input type="month"> because at this time, many
major browsers don't yet support it.

We'll look at basic and more complex uses of <input type="month">, then
offer advice on mitigating the browser support issue in the section
Handling browser support).

Basic uses of month

The simplest use of <input type="month"> involves a basic <input> and
<label> element combination, as seen below:

html

    <form>
      <label for="bday-month">What month were you born in?</label>
      <input id="bday-month" type="month" name="bday-month" />
    </form>

Setting maximum and minimum dates

You can use the min and max attributes to restrict the range of dates
that the user can choose. In the following example we specify a minimum
month of 1900-01 and a maximum month of 2013-12:

html

    <form>
      <label for="bday-month">What month were you born in?</label>
      <input
        id="bday-month"
        type="month"
        name="bday-month"
        min="1900-01"
        max="2013-12" />
    </form>

The result here is that:

-   Only months between in January 1900 and December 2013 can be
    selected; months outside that range can't be scrolled to in the
    control.
-   Depending on what browser you are using, you might find that months
    outside the specified range might not be selectable in the month
    picker (e.g. Edge), or invalid (see Validation) but still available
    (e.g. Chrome).

Controlling input size

<input type="month"> doesn't support form sizing attributes such as
size. You'll have to resort to CSS for sizing needs.

Validation

By default, <input type="month"> does not apply any validation to
entered values. The UI implementations generally don't let you enter
anything that isn't a date — which is helpful — but you can still submit
the form with the month input empty, or enter an invalid date (e.g. the
32nd of April).

To help avoid this, you can use min and max to restrict the available
dates (see Setting maximum and minimum dates), and in addition use the
required attribute to make filling in the date mandatory. As a result,
supporting browsers will display an error if you try to submit a date
that is outside the set bounds, or an empty date field.

Let's look at an example; here we've set minimum and maximum dates, and
also made the field required:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="month">
          What month would you like to visit (June to Sept.)?
        </label>
        <input
          id="month"
          type="month"
          name="month"
          min="2022-06"
          max="2022-09"
          required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
      </div>
    </form>

If you try to submit the form without both the month and year specified
(or with a date outside the set bounds), the browser displays an error.
Try playing with the example now:

Here's a screenshot for those of you who aren't using a supporting
browser:

[Month required prompt on Chrome browser]

Here's the CSS used in the above example. Here we make use of the :valid
and :invalid CSS properties to style the input based on whether the
current value is valid. We had to put the icons on a <span> next to the
input, not on the input itself, because in Chrome the generated content
is placed inside the form control, and can't be styled or shown
effectively.

css

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

Warning: HTML form validation is not a substitute for scripts that
ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy
for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass
the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone
to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your
server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives,
disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or
data which is too large, of the wrong type, and so forth).

Handling browser support

As mentioned above, the major problem with using date inputs at the time
of writing is that many major browsers don't yet implement them all;
only Chrome/Opera and Edge support it on desktop, and most modern
browsers on mobile. As an example, the month picker on Chrome for
Android looks like this:

[Month picker on Chrome for Android]

Non-supporting browsers gracefully degrade to a text input, but this
creates problems both in terms of consistency of user interface (the
presented control will be different), and data handling.

The second problem is the more serious of the two. As mentioned earlier,
with a month input the actual value is always normalized to the format
yyyy-mm. On the other hand, in its default configuration, a text input
has no idea what format the date should be in, and this is an issue
because of the number of different ways in which people write dates. For
example:

-   mmyyyy (072022)
-   mm/yyyy (07/2022)
-   mm-yyyy (07-2022)
-   yyyy-mm (2022-07)
-   Month yyyy (July 2022)
-   and so forth…

One way around this is to put a pattern attribute on your month input.
Even though the month input doesn't use it, if the browser falls back to
treating it like a text input, the pattern will be used. For example,
try viewing the following demo in a browser that doesn't support month
inputs:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="month">
          What month would you like to visit (June to Sept.)?
        </label>
        <input
          id="month"
          type="month"
          name="month"
          min="2022-06"
          max="2022-09"
          required
          pattern="[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
      </div>
    </form>

If you try submitting it, you'll see that the browser now displays an
error message (and highlights the input as invalid) if your entry
doesn't match the pattern nnnn-nn, where n is a number from 0 to 9. Of
course, this doesn't stop people from entering invalid dates (such as
0000-42), or incorrectly formatted dates that follow the pattern.

There's also the problem that the user won't necessarily know which of
the many date formats is expected. We have work left to do.

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

The best way to deal with dates in forms in a cross-browser way (until
all major browsers have supported them for a while) is to get the user
to enter the month and year in separate controls (<select> elements
being popular; see below for an implementation), or use JavaScript
libraries such as the jQuery date picker plugin.

Examples

In this example, we create two sets of UI elements, each designed to let
the user select a month and year. The first is a native month input, and
the other is a pair of <select> elements that allow choosing a month and
year independently, for compatibility with browsers that don't yet
support <input type="month">.

HTML

The form that requests the month and year looks like this:

html

    <form>
      <div class="nativeDatePicker">
        <label for="month-visit">What month would you like to visit us?</label>
        <input type="month" id="month-visit" name="month-visit" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <p class="fallbackLabel">What month would you like to visit us?</p>
      <div class="fallbackDatePicker">
        <div>
          <span>
            <label for="month">Month:</label>
            <select id="month" name="month">
              <option selected>January</option>
              <option>February</option>

            </select>
          </span>
          <span>
            <label for="year">Year:</label>
            <select id="year" name="year"></select>
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </form>

The <div> with the ID nativeDatePicker uses the month input type to
request the month and year, while the <div> with the ID
fallbackDatePicker instead uses a pair of <select> elements. The first
requests the month, and the second the year.

The <select> for choosing the month is hardcoded with the names of the
months, as they don't change (leaving localization out of things). The
list of available year values is dynamically generated depending on the
current year (see the code comments below for detailed explanations of
how these functions work).

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

JavaScript

The JavaScript code that handles selecting which approach to use and to
set up the list of years to include in the non-native year <select>
follows.

The part of the example that may be of most interest is the feature
detection code. In order to detect whether the browser supports
<input type="month">, we create a new <input> element, try setting its
type to month, then immediately check what its type is set to. Browsers
that don't support type month will return text, since that's What month
falls back to when not supported. If <input type="month"> is not
supported, we hide the native picker and show the fallback picker UI
instead.

js

    // Get UI elements
    const nativePicker = document.querySelector(".nativeDatePicker");
    const fallbackPicker = document.querySelector(".fallbackDatePicker");
    const fallbackLabel = document.querySelector(".fallbackLabel");

    const yearSelect = document.querySelector("#year");
    const monthSelect = document.querySelector("#month");

    // Hide fallback initially
    fallbackPicker.style.display = "none";
    fallbackLabel.style.display = "none";

    // Test whether a new date input falls back to a text input or not
    const test = document.createElement("input");

    try {
      test.type = "month";
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e.description);
    }

    // If it does, run the code inside the if () {} block
    if (test.type === "text") {
      // Hide the native picker and show the fallback
      nativePicker.style.display = "none";
      fallbackPicker.style.display = "block";
      fallbackLabel.style.display = "block";

      // Populate the years dynamically
      // (the months are always the same, therefore hardcoded)
      populateYears();
    }

    function populateYears() {
      // Get the current year as a number
      const date = new Date();
      const year = date.getFullYear();

      // Make this year, and the 100 years before it available in the year <select>
      for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {
        const option = document.createElement("option");
        option.textContent = year - i;
        yearSelect.appendChild(option);
      }
    }

Note: Remember that some years have 53 weeks in them (see Weeks per
year)! You'll need to take this into consideration when developing
production apps.

# <input type="number">#

<input> elements of type number are used to let the user enter a number.
They include built-in validation to reject non-numerical entries.

The browser may opt to provide stepper arrows to let the user increase
and decrease the value using their mouse or by tapping with a fingertip.

On browsers that don't support inputs of type number, a number input
falls back to type text.

Value

A number representing the value of the number entered into the input.
You can set a default value for the input by including a number inside
the value attribute, like so:

html

    <input id="number" type="number" value="42" />

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes commonly supported by all <input> types,
inputs of type number support these attributes.

list

The values of the list attribute is the id of a <datalist> element
located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of
predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in
the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the
suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not
requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a
different value.

max

The maximum value to accept for this input. If the value entered into
the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation. If
the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the element has no
maximum value.

This value must be greater than or equal to the value of the min
attribute.

min

The minimum value to accept for this input. If the value of the element
is less than this, the element fails constraint validation. If a value
is specified for min that isn't a valid number, the input has no minimum
value.

This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute.

placeholder

The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the
user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should
be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data,
rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage
returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality (LTR or RTL) but needs
to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use
Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override
directionality within the placeholder; see How to use Unicode controls
for bidi text for more information.

Note: Avoid using the placeholder attribute if you can. It is not as
semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause
unexpected technical issues with your content. See <input> labels for
more information.

readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited
by the user. Its value can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code
directly setting the HTMLInputElement value property.

Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not
have any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

step

The step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the
value must adhere to, or the special value any, which is described
below. Only values which are equal to the basis for stepping (min if
specified, value otherwise, and an appropriate default value if neither
of those is provided) are valid.

A string value of any means that no stepping is implied, and any value
is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max).

Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping
configuration, the user agent may round to the nearest valid value,
preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally
close options.

The default stepping value for number inputs is 1, allowing only
integers to be entered—unless the stepping base is not an integer.

Using number inputs

The number input type should only be used for incremental numbers,
especially when spinbutton incrementing and decrementing are helpful to
user experience. The number input type is not appropriate for values
that happen to only consist of numbers but aren't strictly speaking a
number, such as postal codes in many countries or credit card numbers.
For non-numeric inputs, consider using a different input type, such as
<input type="tel"> or other <input> type with the inputmode attribute:

html

    <input type="text" inputmode="numeric" pattern="\d*" />

<input type="number"> elements can help simplify your work when building
the user interface and logic for entering numbers into a form. When you
create a number input with the proper type value, number, you get
automatic validation that the entered text is a number, and usually a
set of up and down buttons to step the value up and down.

Warning: Logically, you should not be able to enter characters inside a
number input other than numbers. Some browsers allow invalid characters,
others do not; see Firefox bug 1398528.

Note: A user can tinker with your HTML behind the scenes, so your site
must not use simple client-side validation for any security purposes.
You must verify on the server side any transaction in which the provided
value may have security implications of any kind.

Mobile browsers further help with the user experience by showing a
special keyboard more suited for entering numbers when the user tries to
enter a value.

A simple number input

In its most basic form, a number input can be implemented like this:

html

    <label for="ticketNum">Number of tickets you would like to buy:</label>
    <input id="ticketNum" type="number" name="ticketNum" value="0" />

A number input is considered valid when empty and when a single number
is entered, but is otherwise invalid. If the required attribute is used,
the input is no longer considered valid when empty.

Note: Any number is an acceptable value, as long as it is a valid
floating point number (that is, not NaN or Infinity).

Placeholders

Sometimes it's helpful to offer an in-context hint as to what form the
input data should take. This can be especially important if the page
design doesn't offer descriptive labels for each <input>. This is where
placeholders come in. A placeholder is a value most commonly used to
provide a hint as to the format the input should take value. It is
displayed inside the edit box when the element's value is "". Once data
is entered into the box, the placeholder disappears; if the box is
emptied, the placeholder reappears.

Here, we have an number input with the placeholder "Multiple of 10".
Note how the placeholder disappears and reappears as you manipulate the
contents of the edit field.

html

    <input type="number" placeholder="Multiple of 10" />

Controlling step size

By default, the up and down buttons provided for you to step the number
up and down will step the value up and down by 1. You can change this by
providing a step attribute, which takes as its value a number specifying
the step amount. Our above example contains a placeholder saying that
the value should be a multiple of 10, so it makes sense to add a step
value of 10:

html

    <input type="number" placeholder="multiple of 10" step="10" />

In this example, you should find that the up and down step arrows will
increase and decrease the value by 10 each time, not 1. You can still
manually enter a number that's not a multiple of 10, but it will be
considered invalid.

Specifying minimum and maximum values

You can use the min and max attributes to specify a minimum and maximum
value that the field can have. For example, let's give our example a
minimum of 0, and a maximum of 100:

html

    <input type="number" placeholder="multiple of 10" step="10" min="0" max="100" />

In this updated version, you should find that the up and down step
buttons will not allow you to go below 0 or above 100. You can still
manually enter a number outside these bounds, but it will be considered
invalid.

Allowing decimal values

One issue with number inputs is that their step size is 1 by default. If
you try to enter a number with a decimal (such as "1.0"), it will be
considered invalid. If you want to enter a value that requires decimals,
you'll need to reflect this in the step value (e.g. step="0.01" to allow
decimals to two decimal places). Here's a simple example:

html

    <input type="number" placeholder="1.0" step="0.01" min="0" max="10" />

See that this example allows any value between 0.0 and 10.0, with
decimals to two places. For example, "9.52" is valid, but "9.521" is
not.

Controlling input size

<input> elements of type number don't support form sizing attributes
such as size. You'll have to resort to CSS to change the size of these
controls.

For example, to adjust the width of the input to be only as wide as is
needed to enter a three-digit number, we can change our HTML to include
an id and to shorten our placeholder since the field will be too narrow
for the text we have been using so far:

html

    <input
      type="number"
      placeholder="x10"
      step="10"
      min="0"
      max="100"
      id="number" />

Then we add some CSS to narrow the width of the element with the id
selector #number:

css

    #number {
      width: 3em;
    }

The result looks like this:

Offering suggested values

You can provide a list of default options from which the user can select
by specifying the list attribute, which contains as its value the id of
a <datalist>, which in turn contains one <option> element per suggested
value. Each option's value is the corresponding suggested value for the
number entry box.

html

    <input id="ticketNum" type="number" name="ticketNum" list="defaultNumbers" />
    <span class="validity"></span>

    <datalist id="defaultNumbers">
      <option value="10045678"></option>
      <option value="103421"></option>
      <option value="11111111"></option>
      <option value="12345678"></option>
      <option value="12999922"></option>
    </datalist>

Validation

We have already mentioned a number of validation features of number
inputs, but let's review them now:

-   <input type="number"> elements automatically invalidate any entry
    that isn't a number (or empty, unless required is specified).
-   You can use the required attribute to make an empty entry invalid.
    (In other words, the input must be filled in.)
-   You can use the step attribute to constrain valid values to a
    certain set of steps (e.g., multiples of 10).
-   You can use the min and max attributes to constrain valid values to
    lower and upper bounds.

The following example exhibits all of the above features, as well as
using some CSS to display valid and invalid icons, depending on the
input's value:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="balloons">Number of balloons to order (multiples of 10):</label>
        <input
          id="balloons"
          type="number"
          name="balloons"
          step="10"
          min="0"
          max="100"
          required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="submit" />
      </div>
    </form>

Try submitting the form with different invalid values entered — e.g., no
value; a value below 0 or above 100; a value that is not a multiple of
10; or a non-numerical value — and see how the error messages the
browser gives you differ with different ones.

The CSS applied to this example is as follows:

css

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

Here we use the :invalid and :valid pseudo classes to display an
appropriate invalid or valid icon as generated content on the adjacent
<span> element, as a visual indicator of validity.

We put it on a separate <span> element for added flexibility. Some
browsers don't display generated content very effectively on some types
of form inputs. (Read, for example, the section on <input type="date">
validation.)

Warning: HTML form validation is not a substitute for server-side
scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format!

It's far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow
them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also
possible for someone to bypass your HTML and submit the data directly to
your server.

If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives,
disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or
data which is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth).

Pattern validation

<input type="number"> elements do not support use of the pattern
attribute for making entered values conform to a specific regex pattern.

The rationale for this is that number inputs won't be valid if they
contain anything except numbers, and you can constrain the minimum and
maximum number of valid digits using the min and max attributes (as
explained above).

Examples

We've already covered the fact that by default, the increment is 1, and
you can use the step attribute to allow decimal inputs. Let's take a
closer look.

In the following example is a form for entering the user's height. It
defaults to accepting a height in meters, but you can click the relevant
button to change the form to accept feet and inches instead. The input
for the height in meters accepts decimals to two places.

The HTML looks like this:

html

    <form>
      <div class="metersInputGroup">
        <label for="meters">Enter your height — meters:</label>
        <input
          id="meters"
          type="number"
          name="meters"
          step="0.01"
          min="0"
          placeholder="e.g. 1.78"
          required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="feetInputGroup" style="display: none;">
        <span>Enter your height — </span>
        <label for="feet">feet:</label>
        <input id="feet" type="number" name="feet" min="0" step="1" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
        <label for="inches">inches:</label>
        <input id="inches" type="number" name="inches" min="0" max="11" step="1" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input
          type="button"
          class="meters"
          value="Enter height in feet and inches" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
      </div>
    </form>

You'll see that we are using many of the attributes we've already looked
at in the article earlier on. Since we want to accept a meter value in
centimeters, we've set the step value to 0.01, so that values like 1.78
are not seen as invalid. We've also provided a placeholder for that
input.

We've hidden the feet and inches inputs initially using
style="display: none;", so that meters is the default entry type.

Now, onto the CSS. This looks very similar to the validation styling we
saw before; nothing remarkable here.

css

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

And finally, the JavaScript:

js

    const metersInputGroup = document.querySelector(".metersInputGroup");
    const feetInputGroup = document.querySelector(".feetInputGroup");
    const metersInput = document.querySelector("#meters");
    const feetInput = document.querySelector("#feet");
    const inchesInput = document.querySelector("#inches");
    const switchBtn = document.querySelector('input[type="button"]');

    switchBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
      if (switchBtn.getAttribute("class") === "meters") {
        switchBtn.setAttribute("class", "feet");
        switchBtn.value = "Enter height in meters";

        metersInputGroup.style.display = "none";
        feetInputGroup.style.display = "block";

        feetInput.setAttribute("required", "");
        inchesInput.setAttribute("required", "");
        metersInput.removeAttribute("required");

        metersInput.value = "";
      } else {
        switchBtn.setAttribute("class", "meters");
        switchBtn.value = "Enter height in feet and inches";

        metersInputGroup.style.display = "block";
        feetInputGroup.style.display = "none";

        feetInput.removeAttribute("required");
        inchesInput.removeAttribute("required");
        metersInput.setAttribute("required", "");

        feetInput.value = "";
        inchesInput.value = "";
      }
    });

After declaring a few variables, an event listener is added to the
button to control the switching mechanism. This is pretty simple, mostly
involving changing over the button's class and <label>, and updating the
display values of the two sets of inputs when the button is pressed.

(Note that we're not converting back and forth between meters and
feet/inches here, which a real-life web application would probably do.)

Note: When the user clicks the button, the required attribute(s) are
removed from the input(s) we are hiding, and empty the value
attribute(s). This is so the form can be submitted if both input sets
aren't filled in. It also ensures that the form won't submit data that
the user didn't mean to.

If you didn't do this, you'd have to fill in both feet/inches and meters
to submit the form!

Accessibility concerns

The implicit role for the <input type="number"> element is spinbutton.
If spinbutton is not an important feature for your form control,
consider not using type="number". Instead, use inputmode="numeric" along
with a pattern attribute that limits the characters to numbers and
associated characters. With <input type="number">, there is a risk of
users accidentally incrementing a number when they're trying to do
something else. Additionally, if users try to enter something that's not
a number, there's no explicit feedback about what they're doing wrong.

Also consider using the autocomplete attribute to help users complete
forms more quickly and with fewer chances of errors. For example, to
enable autofill on a zip code field, set autocomplete="postal-code".

# <input type="password">#

<input> elements of type password provide a way for the user to securely
enter a password.

The element is presented as a one-line plain text editor control in
which the text is obscured so that it cannot be read, usually by
replacing each character with a symbol such as the asterisk ("*") or a
dot ("•"). This character will vary depending on the user agent and
operating system.

%html-content%

The precise behavior of the entry process may vary from browser to
browser. Some browsers display the typed character for a moment before
obscuring it, while others allow the user to toggle the display of
plain-text on and off. Both approaches help a user check that they
entered the intended password, which can be particularly difficult on
mobile devices.

Note: Any forms involving sensitive information like passwords (such as
login forms) should be served over HTTPS. Many browsers now implement
mechanisms to warn against insecure login forms; see Insecure passwords.

Value

The value attribute contains a string whose value is the current
contents of the text editing control being used to enter the password.
If the user hasn't entered anything yet, this value is an empty string
(""). If the required property is specified, then the password edit box
must contain a value other than an empty string to be valid.

If the pattern attribute is specified, the content of a password control
is only considered valid if the value passes validation; see Validation
for more information.

Note: The line feed (U+000A) and carriage return (U+000D) characters are
not permitted in a password value. When setting the value of a password
control, line feed and carriage return characters are stripped out of
the value.

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes that operate on all <input> elements
regardless of their type, password field inputs support the following
attributes.

maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the password field. This must be an integer value of 0 or
higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified,
the password field has no maximum length. This value must also be
greater than or equal to the value of minlength.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long.

minlength

The minimum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the password entry field. This must be a non-negative
integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength.
If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the
password input has no minimum length.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long.

pattern

The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the
input's value must match for the value to pass constraint validation. It
must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp
type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u'
flag is specified when compiling the regular expression, so that the
pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as
ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular
expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

Note: Use the title attribute to specify text that most browsers will
display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the
pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

Use of a pattern is strongly recommended for password inputs, in order
to help ensure that valid passwords using a wide assortment of character
classes are selected and used by your users. With a pattern, you can
mandate case rules, require the use of some number of digits and/or
punctuation characters, and so forth. See the section Validation for
details and an example.

placeholder

The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the
user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should
be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data,
rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage
returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality (LTR or RTL) but needs
to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use
Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override
directionality within the placeholder; see How to use Unicode controls
for bidi text for more information.

Note: Avoid using the placeholder attribute if you can. It is not as
semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause
unexpected technical issues with your content. See <input> labels for
more information.

readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited
by the user. Its value can, however, still be changed from JavaScript
code that directly sets the value of the HTMLInputElement.value
property.

Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not
have any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

size

The size attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters
wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than
zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may
or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the
resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of
characters, depending on the characters and the font (font settings in
use).

This does not set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into
the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a
time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the
maxlength attribute.

Using password inputs

Password input boxes generally work just like other textual input boxes;
the main difference is the obscuring of the content to prevent people
near the user from reading the password.

A simple password input

Here we see the most basic password input, with a label established
using the <label> element.

html

    <label for="userPassword">Password: </label>
    <input id="userPassword" type="password" />

Allowing autocomplete

To allow the user's password manager to automatically enter the
password, specify the autocomplete attribute. For passwords, this should
typically be one of the following:

on

    Allow the browser or a password manager to automatically fill out
    the password field. This isn't as informative as using either
    current-password or new-password.

off

    Don't allow the browser or password manager to automatically fill
    out the password field. Note that some software ignores this value,
    since it's typically harmful to users' ability to maintain safe
    password practices.

current-password

    Allow the browser or password manager to enter the current password
    for the site. This provides more information than on does, since it
    lets the browser or password manager automatically enter
    currently-known password for the site in the field, but not to
    suggest a new one.

new-password

    Allow the browser or password manager to automatically enter a new
    password for the site; this is used on "change your password" and
    "new user" forms, on the field asking the user for a new password.
    The new password may be generated in a variety of ways, depending on
    the password manager in use. It may fill in a new suggested
    password, or it might show the user an interface for creating one.

html

    <label for="userPassword">Password:</label>
    <input id="userPassword" type="password" autocomplete="current-password" />

Making the password mandatory

To tell the user's browser that the password field must have a valid
value before the form can be submitted, specify the Boolean required
attribute.

html

    <label for="userPassword">Password: </label>
    <input id="userPassword" type="password" required />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />

Specifying an input mode

If your recommended (or required) password syntax rules would benefit
from an alternate text entry interface than the standard keyboard, you
can use the inputmode attribute to request a specific one. The most
obvious use case for this is if the password is required to be numeric
(such as a PIN). Mobile devices with virtual keyboards, for example, may
opt to switch to a numeric keypad layout instead of a full keyboard, to
make entering the password easier. If the PIN is for one-time use, set
the autocomplete attribute to either off or one-time-code to suggest
that it's not saved.

html

    <label for="pin">PIN: </label>
    <input id="pin" type="password" inputmode="numeric" />

Setting length requirements

As usual, you can use the minlength and maxlength attributes to
establish minimum and maximum acceptable lengths for the password. This
example expands on the previous one by specifying that the user's PIN
must be at least four and no more than eight digits. The size attribute
is used to ensure that the password entry control is eight characters
wide.

html

    <label for="pin">PIN:</label>
    <input
      id="pin"
      type="password"
      inputmode="numeric"
      minlength="4"
      maxlength="8"
      size="8" />

Selecting text

As with other textual entry controls, you can use the select() method to
select all the text in the password field.

HTML

html

    <label for="userPassword">Password: </label>
    <input id="userPassword" type="password" size="12" />
    <button id="selectAll">Select All</button>

JavaScript

js

    document.getElementById("selectAll").onclick = () => {
      document.getElementById("userPassword").select();
    };

Result

You can also use selectionStart and selectionEnd to get (or set) what
range of characters in the control are currently selected, and
selectionDirection to know which direction selection occurred in (or
will be extended in, depending on your platform; see its documentation
for an explanation). However, given that the text is obscured, the
usefulness of these is somewhat limited.

Validation

If your application has character set restrictions or any other
requirement for the actual content of the entered password, you can use
the pattern attribute to establish a regular expression to be used to
automatically ensure that your passwords meet those requirements.

In this example, only values consisting of at least four and no more
than eight hexadecimal digits are valid.

html

    <label for="hexId">Hex ID: </label>
    <input
      id="hexId"
      type="password"
      pattern="[0-9a-fA-F]{4,8}"
      title="Enter an ID consisting of 4-8 hexadecimal digits"
      autocomplete="new-password" />

Examples

Requesting a Social Security number

This example only accepts input which matches the format for a valid
United States Social Security Number. These numbers, used for tax and
identification purposes in the US, are in the form "123-45-6789".
Assorted rules for what values are permitted in each group exist as
well.

HTML

html

    <label for="ssn">SSN:</label>
    <input
      type="password"
      id="ssn"
      inputmode="numeric"
      minlength="9"
      maxlength="12"
      pattern="(?!000)([0-6]\d{2}|7([0-6]\d|7[012]))([ -])?(?!00)\d\d\3(?!0000)\d{4}"
      required
      autocomplete="off" />
    <br />
    <label for="ssn">Value:</label>
    <span id="current"></span>

This uses a pattern which limits the entered value to strings
representing legal Social Security numbers. Obviously, this regexp
doesn't guarantee a valid SSN (since we don't have access to the Social
Security Administration's database), but it does ensure the number could
be one; it generally avoids values that cannot be valid. In addition, it
allows the three groups of digits to be separated by a space, a dash
("-"), or nothing.

The inputmode is set to numeric to encourage devices with virtual
keyboards to switch to a numeric keypad layout for easier entry. The
minlength and maxlength attributes are set to 9 and 12, respectively, to
require that the value be at least nine and no more than 12 characters
(the former without separating characters between the groups of digits
and the latter with them). The required attribute is used to indicate
that this control must have a value. Finally, autocomplete is set to off
to avoid password managers and session restore features trying to set
its value, since this isn't a password at all.

JavaScript

This is just some simple code to display the entered SSN onscreen so you
can see it. Obviously this defeats the purpose of a password field, but
it's helpful for experimenting with the pattern.

js

    const ssn = document.getElementById("ssn");
    const current = document.getElementById("current");

    ssn.oninput = (event) => {
      current.textContent = ssn.value;
    };

# <input type="radio">#

<input> elements of type radio are generally used in radio
groups—collections of radio buttons describing a set of related options.

Only one radio button in a given group can be selected at the same time.
Radio buttons are typically rendered as small circles, which are filled
or highlighted when selected.

They are called radio buttons because they look and operate in a similar
manner to the push buttons on old-fashioned radios, such as the one
shown below.

[Shows what radio buttons looked like in the olden days.]

Note: Checkboxes are similar to radio buttons, but with an important
distinction: radio buttons are designed for selecting one value out of a
set, whereas checkboxes let you turn individual values on and off. Where
multiple controls exist, radio buttons allow one to be selected out of
them all, whereas checkboxes allow multiple values to be selected.

Value

The value attribute is a string containing the radio button's value. The
value is never shown to the user by their user agent. Instead, it's used
to identify which radio button in a group is selected.

Defining a radio group

A radio group is defined by giving each of radio buttons in the group
the same name. Once a radio group is established, selecting any radio
button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected
radio button in the same group.

You can have as many radio groups on a page as you like, as long as each
has its own unique name.

For example, if your form needs to ask the user for their preferred
contact method, you might create three radio buttons, each with the name
property set to contact but one with the value email, one with the value
phone, and one with the value mail. The user never sees the value or the
name (unless you expressly add code to display it).

The resulting HTML looks like this:

html

    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Please select your preferred contact method:</legend>
        <div>
          <input type="radio" id="contactChoice1" name="contact" value="email" />
          <label for="contactChoice1">Email</label>

          <input type="radio" id="contactChoice2" name="contact" value="phone" />
          <label for="contactChoice2">Phone</label>

          <input type="radio" id="contactChoice3" name="contact" value="mail" />
          <label for="contactChoice3">Mail</label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </div>
      </fieldset>
    </form>

Here you see the three radio buttons, each with the name set to contact
and each with a unique value that uniquely identifies that individual
radio button within the group. They each also have a unique id, which is
used by the <label> element's for attribute to associate the labels with
the radio buttons.

You can try out this example here:

Data representation of a radio group

When the above form is submitted with a radio button selected, the
form's data includes an entry in the form contact=value. For example, if
the user clicks on the "Phone" radio button then submits the form, the
form's data will include the line contact=phone.

If you omit the value attribute in the HTML, the submitted form data
assigns the value on to the group. In this scenario, if the user clicked
on the "Phone" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data
would be contact=on, which isn't helpful. So don't forget to set your
value attributes!

Note: If no radio button is selected when the form is submitted, the
radio group is not included in the submitted form data at all, since
there is no value to report.

It's fairly uncommon to actually want to allow the form to be submitted
without any of the radio buttons in a group selected, so it is usually
wise to have one default to the checked state. See Selecting a radio
button by default below.

Let's add a bit of code to our example so we can examine the data
generated by this form. The HTML is revised to add a <pre> block to
output the form data into:

html

    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Please select your preferred contact method:</legend>
        <div>
          <input type="radio" id="contactChoice1" name="contact" value="email" />
          <label for="contactChoice1">Email</label>
          <input type="radio" id="contactChoice2" name="contact" value="phone" />
          <label for="contactChoice2">Phone</label>
          <input type="radio" id="contactChoice3" name="contact" value="mail" />
          <label for="contactChoice3">Mail</label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </div>
      </fieldset>
    </form>
    <pre id="log"></pre>

Then we add some JavaScript to set up an event listener on the submit
event, which is sent when the user clicks the "Submit" button:

js

    const form = document.querySelector("form");
    const log = document.querySelector("#log");

    form.addEventListener(
      "submit",
      (event) => {
        const data = new FormData(form);
        let output = "";
        for (const entry of data) {
          output = `${output}${entry[0]}=${entry[1]}\r`;
        }
        log.innerText = output;
        event.preventDefault();
      },
      false,
    );

Try this example out and see how there's never more than one result for
the contact group.

Additional attributes

In addition to the common attributes shared by all <input> elements,
radio inputs support the following attributes.

checked

    A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that this radio
    button is the default selected one in the group.

    Unlike other browsers, Firefox by default persists the dynamic
    checked state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete
    attribute to control this feature.

value

    The value attribute is one which all <input>s share; however, it
    serves a special purpose for inputs of type radio: when a form is
    submitted, only radio buttons which are currently checked are
    submitted to the server, and the reported value is the value of the
    value attribute. If the value is not otherwise specified, it is the
    string on by default. This is demonstrated in the section Value
    above.

required

    The required attribute is one which most <input>s share. If any
    radio button in a same-named group of radio buttons has the required
    attribute, a radio button in that group must be checked, although it
    doesn't have to be the one with the attribute applied.

Using radio inputs

We already covered the fundamentals of radio buttons above. Let's now
look at the other common radio-button-related features and techniques
you may need to know about.

Selecting a radio button by default

To make a radio button selected by default, you include checked
attribute, as shown in this revised version of the previous example:

html

    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Please select your preferred contact method:</legend>
        <div>
          <input
            type="radio"
            id="contactChoice1"
            name="contact"
            value="email"
            checked />
          <label for="contactChoice1">Email</label>

          <input type="radio" id="contactChoice2" name="contact" value="phone" />
          <label for="contactChoice2">Phone</label>

          <input type="radio" id="contactChoice3" name="contact" value="mail" />
          <label for="contactChoice3">Mail</label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </div>
      </fieldset>
    </form>

In this case, the first radio button is now selected by default.

Note: If you put the checked attribute on more than one radio button,
later instances will override earlier ones; that is, the last checked
radio button will be the one that is selected. This is because only one
radio button in a group can ever be selected at once, and the user agent
automatically deselects others each time a new one is marked as checked.

Providing a bigger hit area for your radio buttons

In the above examples, you may have noticed that you can select a radio
button by clicking on its associated <label> element, as well as on the
radio button itself. This is a really useful feature of HTML form labels
that makes it easier for users to click the option they want, especially
on small-screen devices like smartphones.

Beyond accessibility, this is another good reason to properly set up
<label> elements on your forms.

Validation

Radio buttons don't participate in constraint validation; they have no
real value to be constrained.

Styling radio inputs

The following example shows a slightly more thorough version of the
example we've seen throughout the article, with some additional styling,
and with better semantics established through use of specialized
elements. The HTML looks like this:

html

    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Please select your preferred contact method:</legend>
        <div>
          <input
            type="radio"
            id="contactChoice1"
            name="contact"
            value="email"
            checked />
          <label for="contactChoice1">Email</label>

          <input type="radio" id="contactChoice2" name="contact" value="phone" />
          <label for="contactChoice2">Phone</label>

          <input type="radio" id="contactChoice3" name="contact" value="mail" />
          <label for="contactChoice3">Mail</label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </div>
      </fieldset>
    </form>

The CSS involved in this example is a bit more significant:

css

    html {
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }

    div:first-of-type {
      display: flex;
      align-items: flex-start;
      margin-bottom: 5px;
    }

    label {
      margin-right: 15px;
      line-height: 32px;
    }

    input {
      appearance: none;

      border-radius: 50%;
      width: 16px;
      height: 16px;

      border: 2px solid #999;
      transition: 0.2s all linear;
      margin-right: 5px;

      position: relative;
      top: 4px;
    }

    input:checked {
      border: 6px solid black;
    }

    button,
    legend {
      color: white;
      background-color: black;
      padding: 5px 10px;
      border-radius: 0;
      border: 0;
      font-size: 14px;
    }

    button:hover,
    button:focus {
      color: #999;
    }

    button:active {
      background-color: white;
      color: black;
      outline: 1px solid black;
    }

Most notable here is the use of the appearance property (with prefixes
needed to support some browsers). By default, radio buttons (and
checkboxes) are styled with the operating system's native styles for
those controls. By specifying appearance: none, you can remove the
native styling altogether, and create your own styles for them. Here
we've used a border along with border-radius and a transition to create
a nice animating radio selection. Notice also how the :checked
pseudo-class is used to specify the styles for the radio button's
appearance when selected.

Note: If you wish to use the appearance property, you should test it
very carefully. Although it is supported in most modern browsers, its
implementation varies widely. In older browsers, even the keyword none
does not have the same effect across different browsers, and some do not
support it at all. The differences are smaller in the newest browsers.

Notice that when clicking on a radio button, there's a nice, smooth fade
out/in effect as the two buttons change state. In addition, the style
and coloring of the legend and submit button are customized to have
strong contrast. This might not be a look you'd want in a real web
application, but it definitely shows off the possibilities.

# <input type="range">#

<input> elements of type range let the user specify a numeric value
which must be no less than a given value, and no more than another given
value. The precise value, however, is not considered important. This is
typically represented using a slider or dial control rather than a text
entry box like the number input type.

Because this kind of widget is imprecise, it should only be used if the
control's exact value isn't important.

If the user's browser doesn't support type range, it will fall back and
treat it as a text input.

Validation

There is no pattern validation available; however, the following forms
of automatic validation are performed:

-   If the value is set to something which can't be converted into a
    valid floating-point number, validation fails because the input is
    suffering from a bad input.
-   The value won't be less than min. The default is 0.
-   The value won't be greater than max. The default is 100.
-   The value will be a multiple of step. The default is 1.

Value

The value attribute contains a string which contains a string
representation of the selected number. The value is never an empty
string (""). The default value is halfway between the specified minimum
and maximum—unless the maximum is actually less than the minimum, in
which case the default is set to the value of the min attribute. The
algorithm for determining the default value is:

js

    defaultValue =
      rangeElem.max < rangeElem.min
        ? rangeElem.min
        : rangeElem.min + (rangeElem.max - rangeElem.min) / 2;

If an attempt is made to set the value lower than the minimum, it is set
to the minimum. Similarly, an attempt to set the value higher than the
maximum results in it being set to the maximum.

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes shared by all <input> elements, range
inputs offer the following attributes.

list

The value of the list attribute is the id of a <datalist> element
located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of
predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in
the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the
suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not
requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a
different value.

See the adding tick marks below for an example of how the options on a
range are denoted in supported browsers.

max

The greatest value in the range of permitted values. If the value
entered into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint
validation. If the value of the max attribute isn't a number, then the
element has no maximum value.

This value must be greater than or equal to the value of the min
attribute. See the HTML max attribute.

min

The lowest value in the range of permitted values. If the value of the
element is less than this, the element fails constraint validation. If a
value is specified for min that isn't a valid number, the input has no
minimum value.

This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute.
See the HTML min attribute.

Note: If the min and max values are equal or the max value is lower than
the min value the user will not be able to interact with the range.

step

The step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the
value must adhere to. Only values that match the specified stepping
interval (min if specified, value otherwise, or an appropriate default
value if neither of those is provided) are valid.

The step attribute can also be set to the any string value. This step
value means that no stepping interval is implied and any value is
allowed in the specified range (barring other constraints, such as min
and max). See the Setting step to the any value example for how this
works in supported browsers.

Note: When the value entered by a user doesn't adhere to the stepping
configuration, the user agent may round off the value to the nearest
valid value, preferring to round numbers up when there are two equally
close options.

The default stepping value for range inputs is 1, allowing only integers
to be entered, unless the stepping base is not an integer; for example,
if you set min to -10 and value to 1.5, then a step of 1 will allow only
values such as 1.5, 2.5, 3.5,… in the positive direction and -0.5, -1.5,
-2.5,… in the negative direction. See the HTML step attribute.

Non-standard Attributes

orient

Similar to the -moz-orient non-standard CSS property impacting the
<progress> and <meter> elements, the orient attribute defines the
orientation of the range slider. Values include horizontal, meaning the
range is rendered horizontally, and vertical, where the range is
rendered vertically.

Note: The following input attributes do not apply to the input range:
accept, alt, checked, dirname, formaction, formenctype, formmethod,
formnovalidate, formtarget, height, maxlength, minlength, multiple,
pattern, placeholder, readonly, required, size, and src. Any of these
attributes, if included, will be ignored.

Examples

While the number type lets users enter a number with optional
constraints forcing their value to be between a minimum and a maximum
value, it does require that they enter a specific value. The range input
type lets you ask the user for a value in cases where the user may not
even care—or know—what the specific numeric value selected is.

A few examples of situations in which range inputs are commonly used:

-   Audio controls such as volume and balance, or filter controls.
-   Color configuration controls such as color channels, transparency,
    brightness, etc.
-   Game configuration controls such as difficulty, visibility distance,
    world size, and so forth.
-   Password length for a password manager's generated passwords.

As a rule, if the user is more likely to be interested in the percentage
of the distance between minimum and maximum values than the actual
number itself, a range input is a great candidate. For example, in the
case of a home stereo volume control, users typically think "set volume
at halfway to maximum" instead of "set volume to 0.5".

Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the minimum is 0 and the maximum is 100. If that's not what
you want, you can easily specify different bounds by changing the values
of the min and/or max attributes. These can be any floating-point value.

For example, to ask the user for a value between -10 and 10, you can
use:

html

    <input type="range" min="-10" max="10" />

Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity is 1, meaning the value is always an
integer. To control the granularity, you can change the step attribute.
For example, If you need a value to be halfway between 5 and 10, you
should set the value of step to 0.5:

Setting the step attribute

html

    <input type="range" min="5" max="10" step="0.5" />

Setting step to any

If you want to accept any value regardless of how many decimal places it
extends to, you can specify a value of any for the step attribute:

HTML

html

    <input id="pi_input" type="range" min="0" max="3.14" step="any" />
    <p>Value: <output id="value"></output></p>

JavaScript

js

    const value = document.querySelector("#value");
    const input = document.querySelector("#pi_input");
    value.textContent = input.value;
    input.addEventListener("input", (event) => {
      value.textContent = event.target.value;
    });

This example lets the user select any value between 0 and π without any
restriction on the fractional part of the value selected. JavaScript is
used to show how the value changes as the user interacts with the range.

Adding tick marks

To add tick marks to a range control, include the list attribute, giving
it the id of a <datalist> element which defines a series of tick marks
on the control. Each point is represented using an <option> element with
its value set to the range's value at which a mark should be drawn.

HTML

html

    <label for="temp">Choose a comfortable temperature:</label><br />
    <input type="range" id="temp" name="temp" list="markers" />

    <datalist id="markers">
      <option value="0"></option>
      <option value="25"></option>
      <option value="50"></option>
      <option value="75"></option>
      <option value="100"></option>
    </datalist>

Result

Using the same datalist for multiple range controls

To help you from repeating code you can reuse that same <datalist> for
multiple <input type="range"> elements, and other <input> types.

Note: If you also want to show the labels as in the example below then
you would need a datalist for each range input.

HTML

html

    <p>
      <label for="temp1">Temperature for room 1:</label>
      <input type="range" id="temp1" name="temp1" list="values" />
    </p>
    <p>
      <label for="temp2">Temperature for room 2:</label>
      <input type="range" id="temp2" name="temp2" list="values" />
    </p>

    <p>
      <label for="temp3">Temperature for room 3:</label>
      <input type="range" id="temp3" name="temp3" list="values" />
    </p>

    <datalist id="values">
      <option value="0" label="0"></option>
      <option value="25" label="25"></option>
      <option value="50" label="50"></option>
      <option value="75" label="75"></option>
      <option value="100" label="100"></option>
    </datalist>

Result

Adding labels

You can label tick marks by giving the <option> elements label
attributes. However, the label content will not be displayed by default.
You can use CSS to show the labels and to position them correctly.
Here's one way you could do this.

HTML

html

    <label for="tempB">Choose a comfortable temperature:</label><br />
    <input type="range" id="tempB" name="temp" list="values" />

    <datalist id="values">
      <option value="0" label="very cold!"></option>
      <option value="25" label="cool"></option>
      <option value="50" label="medium"></option>
      <option value="75" label="getting warm!"></option>
      <option value="100" label="hot!"></option>
    </datalist>

CSS

css

    datalist {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: space-between;
      writing-mode: vertical-lr;
      width: 200px;
    }

    option {
      padding: 0;
    }

    input[type="range"] {
      width: 200px;
      margin: 0;
    }

Result

Creating vertical range controls

By default, browsers render range inputs as sliders with the knob
sliding left and right.

To create a vertical range, wherein the knob slides up and down, set the
CSS appearance property to slider-vertical and include the non-standard
orient attribute for Firefox.

Horizontal range control

Consider this range control:

html

    <input type="range" id="volume" min="0" max="11" value="7" step="1" />

This control is horizontal (at least on most if not all major browsers;
others might vary).

Using the appearance property

The appearance property has a non-standard value of slider-vertical
that, well, makes sliders vertical.

We use the same HTML as in the previous examples:

html

    <input type="range" min="0" max="11" value="7" step="1" />

We target just the inputs with a type of range:

css

    input[type="range"] {
      appearance: slider-vertical;
    }

Using the orient attribute

In Firefox only, there is a non-standard orient property.

Use similar HTML as in the previous examples, we add the attribute with
a value of vertical:

html

    <input type="range" min="0" max="11" value="7" step="1" orient="vertical" />

writing-mode: bt-lr

The writing-mode property should generally not be used to alter text
direction for internationalization or localization purposes, but can be
used for special effects.

We use the same HTML as in the previous examples:

html

    <input type="range" min="0" max="11" value="7" step="1" />

We target just the inputs with a type of range, changing the writing
mode from the default to bt-lr, or bottom-to-top and left-to-right:

css

    input[type="range"] {
      writing-mode: bt-lr;
    }

Putting it all together

As each of the above examples works in different browsers, you can put
all of them in a single example to make it work cross browser:

We keep the orient attribute with a value of vertical for Firefox:

html

    <input type="range" min="0" max="11" value="7" step="1" orient="vertical" />

We target just the inputs with a type of range and orient set to
vertical, changing the writing-mode from the default to bt-lr, or
bottom-to-top and left-to-right, for pre-Blink versions of Edge, and add
appearance: slider-vertical which is supported in Blink and Webkit
browsers:

css

    input[type="range"][orient="vertical"] {
      writing-mode: bt-lr;
      appearance: slider-vertical;
    }

Output

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

Note: You should usually avoid including reset buttons in your forms.
They're rarely useful, and are instead more likely to frustrate users
who click them by mistake (often while trying to click the submit
button).

Value

An <input type="reset"> element's value attribute contains a string that
is used as the button's label providing the button with an accessible
description. Buttons such as reset don't have a value otherwise.

Setting the value attribute

html

    <input type="reset" value="Reset the form" />

Omitting the value attribute

If you don't specify a value, you get a button with the default label
(typically "Reset," but this will vary depending on the user agent):

html

    <input type="reset" />

Using reset buttons

<input type="reset"> buttons are used to reset forms. If you want to
create a custom button and then customize the behavior using JavaScript,
you need to use <input type="button">, or better still, a <button>
element.

A simple reset button

We'll begin by creating a simple reset button:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="example">Type in some sample text</label>
        <input id="example" type="text" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="reset" value="Reset the form" />
      </div>
    </form>

This renders like so:

Try entering some text into the text field, and then pressing the reset
button.

Adding a reset keyboard shortcut

To add a keyboard shortcut to a reset button — just as you would with
any <input> for which it makes sense — you use the accesskey global
attribute.

In this example, r is specified as the access key (you'll need to press
r plus the particular modifier keys for your browser/OS combination; see
accesskey for a useful list of those).

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="example">Type in some sample text</label>
        <input id="example" type="text" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="reset" value="Reset the form" accesskey="r" />
      </div>
    </form>

The problem with the above example is that there's no way for the user
to know what the access key is! This is especially true since the
modifiers are typically non-standard to avoid conflicts. When building a
site, be sure to provide this information in a way that doesn't
interfere with the site design (for example by providing an easily
accessible link that points to information on what the site access keys
are). Adding a tooltip to the button (using the title attribute) can
also help, although it's not a complete solution for accessibility
purposes.

Disabling and enabling a reset button

To disable a reset button, specify the disabled attribute on it, like
so:

html

    <input type="reset" value="Disabled" disabled />

You can enable and disable buttons at run time by setting disabled to
true or false; in JavaScript this looks like btn.disabled = true or
btn.disabled = false.

Note: See the <input type="button"> page for more ideas about enabling
and disabling buttons.

Validation

Buttons don't participate in constraint validation; they have no real
value to be constrained.

Examples

We've included simple examples above. There isn't really anything more
to say about reset buttons.

# <input type="search">#

<input> elements of type search are text fields designed for the user to
enter search queries into. These are functionally identical to text
inputs, but may be styled differently by the user agent.

    label {
      margin: 0.4rem 0;
    }

Output

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

Value

The value attribute contains a string representing the value contained
in the search field. You can retrieve this using the
HTMLInputElement.value property in JavaScript.

js

    searchTerms = mySearch.value;

If no validation constraints are in place for the input (see Validation
for more details), the value can be any text string or an empty string
("").

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes that operate on all <input> elements
regardless of their type, search field inputs support the following
attributes.

list

The values of the list attribute is the id of a <datalist> element
located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of
predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in
the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the
suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not
requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a
different value.

maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the search field. This must be an integer value of 0 or
higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified,
the search field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater
than or equal to the value of minlength.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long.

minlength

The minimum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the search field. This must be a non-negative integer
value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no
minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the search
input has no minimum length.

The search field will fail constraint validation if the length of the
text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units
long.

pattern

The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the
input's value must match for the value to pass constraint validation. It
must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp
type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u'
flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the
pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as
ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular
expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

Note: Use the title attribute to specify text that most browsers will
display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the
pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

See the section Specifying a pattern for details and an example.

placeholder

The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the
user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should
be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data,
rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage
returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality (LTR or RTL) but needs
to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use
Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override
directionality within the placeholder; see How to use Unicode controls
for bidi text for more information.

Note: Avoid using the placeholder attribute if you can. It is not as
semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause
unexpected technical issues with your content. See <input> labels for
more information.

readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited
by the user. Its value can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code
directly setting the HTMLInputElement value property.

Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not
have any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

size

The size attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters
wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than
zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may
or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the
resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of
characters, depending on the characters and the font (font settings in
use).

This does not set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into
the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a
time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the
maxlength attribute.

spellcheck

spellcheck is a global attribute which is used to indicate whether to
enable spell checking for an element. It can be used on any editable
content, but here we consider specifics related to the use of spellcheck
on <input> elements. The permitted values for spellcheck are:

false

    Disable spell checking for this element.

true

    Enable spell checking for this element.

"" (empty string) or no value

    Follow the element's default behavior for spell checking. This may
    be based upon a parent's spellcheck setting or other factors.

An input field can have spell checking enabled if it doesn't have the
readonly attribute set and is not disabled.

The value returned by reading spellcheck may not reflect the actual
state of spell checking within a control, if the user agent's
preferences override the setting.

Non-standard attributes

The following non-standard attributes are available to search input
fields. As a general rule, you should avoid using them unless it can't
be helped.

autocorrect

A Safari extension, the autocorrect attribute is a string which
indicates whether to activate automatic correction while the user is
editing this field. Permitted values are:

on

    Enable automatic correction of typos, as well as processing of text
    substitutions if any are configured.

off

    Disable automatic correction and text substitutions.

incremental

The Boolean attribute incremental is a WebKit and Blink extension (so
supported by Safari, Opera, Chrome, etc.) which, if present, tells the
user agent to process the input as a live search. As the user edits the
value of the field, the user agent sends search events to the
HTMLInputElement object representing the search box. This allows your
code to update the search results in real time as the user edits the
search.

If incremental is not specified, the search event is only sent when the
user explicitly initiates a search (such as by pressing the Enter or
Return key while editing the field).

The search event is rate-limited so that it is not sent more frequently
than an implementation-defined interval.

mozactionhint Deprecated

A Mozilla extension, which provides a hint as to what sort of action
will be taken if the user presses the Enter or Return key while editing
the field.

Deprecated: Use enterkeyhint instead.

results

The results attribute—supported only by Safari—is a numeric value that
lets you override the maximum number of entries to be displayed in the
<input> element's natively-provided drop-down menu of previous search
queries.

The value must be a non-negative decimal number. If not provided, or an
invalid value is given, the browser's default maximum number of entries
is used.

Using search inputs

<input> elements of type search are very similar to those of type text,
except that they are specifically intended for handling search terms.
They are basically equivalent in behavior, but user agents may choose to
style them differently by default (and, of course, sites may use
stylesheets to apply custom styles to them).

Basic example

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <input type="search" id="mySearch" name="q" />
        <button>Search</button>
      </div>
    </form>

This renders like so:

q is the most common name given to search inputs, although it's not
mandatory. When submitted, the data name/value pair sent to the server
will be q=searchterm.

Note: You must remember to set a name for your input, otherwise nothing
will be submitted.

Differences between search and text types

The main basic differences come in the way browsers handle them. The
first thing to note is that some browsers show a cross icon that can be
clicked on to remove the search term instantly if desired, in Chrome
this action is also triggered when pressing escape. The following
screenshot comes from Chrome:

[Focused search input, with focus ring, with the text 'cats'. There is
an x icon in the input abutting the right side.]

In addition, modern browsers also tend to automatically store search
terms previously entered across domains, which then come up as
autocomplete options when subsequent searches are performed in search
inputs on that domain. This helps users who tend to do searches on the
same or similar search queries over time. This screenshot is from
Firefox:

[An input in error state with a red focus ring. The user has entered the
letter 'h'. A pop-up selection list is open directly under the input box
with two options: hello and hermansje.]At this point, let's look at some
useful techniques you can apply to your search forms.

Setting placeholders

You can provide a useful placeholder inside your search input that could
give a hint on what to do using the placeholder attribute. Look at the
following example:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <input
          type="search"
          id="mySearch"
          name="q"
          placeholder="Search the site…" />
        <button>Search</button>
      </div>
    </form>

You can see how the placeholder is rendered below:

Search form labels and accessibility

One problem with search forms is their accessibility; a common design
practice is not to provide a label for the search field (although there
might be a magnifying glass icon or similar), as the purpose of a search
form is normally fairly obvious for sighted users due to placement (this
example shows a typical pattern).

This could, however, cause confusion for screen reader users, since they
will not have any verbal indication of what the search input is. One way
around this that won't impact on your visual design is to use WAI-ARIA
features:

-   A role attribute of value search on the <form> element will cause
    screen readers to announce that the form is a search form.
-   If that isn't enough, you can use an aria-label attribute on the
    <input> itself. This should be a descriptive text label that will be
    read out by the screen reader; it's used as a non-visual equivalent
    to <label>.

Let's have a look at an example:

html

    <form role="search">
      <div>
        <input
          type="search"
          id="mySearch"
          name="q"
          placeholder="Search the site…"
          aria-label="Search through site content" />
        <button>Search</button>
      </div>
    </form>

You can see how this is rendered below:

There is no visual difference from the previous example, but screen
reader users have way more information available to them.

Note: See Signposts/Landmarks for more information about such
accessibility features.

Physical input element size

The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the size
attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the input
box can display at a time. In this example, for instance, the search box
is 30 characters wide:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <input
          type="search"
          id="mySearch"
          name="q"
          placeholder="Search the site…"
          size="30" />
        <button>Search</button>
      </div>
    </form>

The result is this wider input box:

Validation

<input> elements of type search have the same validation features
available to them as regular text inputs. It is less likely that you'd
want to use validation features in general for search boxes. In many
cases, users should just be allowed to search for anything, but there
are a few cases to consider, such as searches against data of a known
format.

Note: HTML form validation is not a substitute for scripts that ensure
that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy for
someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the
validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to
bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server.
If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives,
disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data (or data which is
too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into your
database.

A note on styling

There are useful pseudo-classes available for styling valid/invalid form
elements: :valid and :invalid. In this section, we'll use the following
CSS, which will place a check (tick) next to inputs containing valid
values, and a cross next to inputs containing invalid values.

css

    input:invalid ~ span::after {
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
      position: absolute;
    }

    input:valid ~ span::after {
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
      position: absolute;
    }

The technique also requires a <span> element to be placed after the form
element, which acts as a holder for the icons. This was necessary
because some input types on some browsers don't display icons placed
directly after them very well.

Making input required

You can use the required attribute as an easy way of making entering a
value required before form submission is allowed:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <input
          type="search"
          id="mySearch"
          name="q"
          placeholder="Search the site…"
          required />
        <button>Search</button>
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
    </form>

    input {
      margin-right: 10px;
    }

    input:invalid ~ span::after {
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
      position: absolute;
    }

    input:valid ~ span::after {
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
      position: absolute;
    }

This renders like so:

In addition, if you try to submit the form with no search term entered
into it, the browser will show a message. The following example is from
Firefox:

[form field with attached message that says Please fill out this field]

Different messages will be shown when you try to submit the form with
different types of invalid data contained inside the inputs; see the
below examples.

Input value length

You can specify a minimum length, in characters, for the entered value
using the minlength attribute; similarly, use maxlength to set the
maximum length of the entered value.

The example below requires that the entered value be 4–8 characters in
length.

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="mySearch">Search for user</label>
        <input
          type="search"
          id="mySearch"
          name="q"
          placeholder="User IDs are 4–8 characters in length"
          required
          size="30"
          minlength="4"
          maxlength="8" />
        <button>Search</button>
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
    </form>

    input {
      margin-right: 10px;
    }

    input:invalid ~ span::after {
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
      position: absolute;
    }

    input:valid ~ span::after {
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
      position: absolute;
    }

This renders like so:

If you try to submit the form with less than 4 characters, you'll be
given an appropriate error message (which differs between browsers). If
you try to go beyond 8 characters in length, the browser won't let you.

Specifying a pattern

You can use the pattern attribute to specify a regular expression that
the inputted value must follow to be considered valid (see Validating
against a regular expression for a simple crash course).

Let's look at an example. Say we wanted to provide a product ID search
form, and the IDs were all codes of two letters followed by four
numbers. The following example covers it:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="mySearch">Search for product by ID:</label>
        <input
          type="search"
          id="mySearch"
          name="q"
          placeholder="two letters followed by four numbers"
          required
          size="30"
          pattern="[A-z]{2}[0-9]{4}" />
        <button>Search</button>
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
    </form>

    input {
      margin-right: 10px;
    }

    input:invalid ~ span::after {
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
      position: absolute;
    }

    input:valid ~ span::after {
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
      position: absolute;
    }

This renders like so:

Examples

You can see a good example of a search form used in context at our
website-aria-roles example (see it live).

# <input type="submit">#

<input> elements of type submit are rendered as buttons. When the click
event occurs (typically because the user clicked the button), the user
agent attempts to submit the form to the server.

Value

An <input type="submit"> element's value attribute contains a string
which is displayed as the button's label. Buttons do not have a true
value otherwise. The value provides the accessible description for the
button.

Setting the value attribute

html

    <input type="submit" value="Send Request" />

Omitting the value attribute

If you don't specify a value, the button will have a default label,
chosen by the user agent. This label is likely to be something along the
lines of "Submit" or "Submit Query." Here's an example of a submit
button with a default label in your browser:

html

    <input type="submit" />

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes shared by all <input> elements, submit
button inputs support the following attributes.

formaction

A string indicating the URL to which to submit the data. This takes
precedence over the action attribute on the <form> element that owns the
<input>.

This attribute is also available on <input type="image"> and <button>
elements.

formenctype

A string that identifies the encoding method to use when submitting the
form data to the server. There are three permitted values:

application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    This, the default value, sends the form data as a string after URL
    encoding the text using an algorithm such as encodeURI().

multipart/form-data

    Uses the FormData API to manage the data, allowing for files to be
    submitted to the server. You must use this encoding type if your
    form includes any <input> elements of type file
    (<input type="file">).

text/plain

    Plain text; mostly useful only for debugging, so you can easily see
    the data that's to be submitted.

If specified, the value of the formenctype attribute overrides the
owning form's action attribute.

This attribute is also available on <input type="image"> and <button>
elements.

formmethod

A string indicating the HTTP method to use when submitting the form's
data; this value overrides any method attribute given on the owning
form. Permitted values are:

get

    A URL is constructed by starting with the URL given by the
    formaction or action attribute, appending a question mark ("?")
    character, then appending the form's data, encoded as described by
    formenctype or the form's enctype attribute. This URL is then sent
    to the server using an HTTP get request. This method works well for
    simple forms that contain only ASCII characters and have no side
    effects. This is the default value.

post

    The form's data is included in the body of the request that is sent
    to the URL given by the formaction or action attribute using an HTTP
    post method. This method supports complex data and file attachments.

dialog

    This method is used to indicate that the button closes the dialog
    with which the input is associated, and does not transmit the form
    data at all.

This attribute is also available on <input type="image"> and <button>
elements.

formnovalidate

A Boolean attribute which, if present, specifies that the form should
not be validated before submission to the server. This overrides the
value of the novalidate attribute on the element's owning form.

This attribute is also available on <input type="image"> and <button>
elements.

formtarget

A string which specifies a name or keyword that indicates where to
display the response received after submitting the form. The string must
be the name of a browsing context (that is, a tab, window, or <iframe>).
A value specified here overrides any target given by the target
attribute on the <form> that owns this input.

In addition to the actual names of tabs, windows, or inline frames,
there are a few special keywords that can be used:

_self

    Loads the response into the same browsing context as the one that
    contains the form. This will replace the current document with the
    received data. This is the default value used if none is specified.

_blank

    Loads the response into a new, unnamed, browsing context. This is
    typically a new tab in the same window as the current document, but
    may differ depending on the configuration of the user agent.

_parent

    Loads the response into the parent browsing context of the current
    one. If there is no parent context, this behaves the same as _self.

_top

    Loads the response into the top-level browsing context; this is the
    browsing context that is the topmost ancestor of the current
    context. If the current context is the topmost context, this behaves
    the same as _self.

This attribute is also available on <input type="image"> and <button>
elements.

Using submit buttons

<input type="submit"> buttons are used to submit forms. If you want to
create a custom button and then customize the behavior using JavaScript,
you need to use <input type="button">, or better still, a <button>
element.

If you choose to use <button> elements to create the buttons in your
form, keep this in mind: If the <button> is inside a <form>, that button
will be treated as the "submit" button. So you should be in the habit of
expressly specifying which button is the submit button.

A simple submit button

We'll begin by creating a form with a simple submit button:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="example">Let's submit some text</label>
        <input id="example" type="text" name="text" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Send" />
      </div>
    </form>

This renders like so:

Try entering some text into the text field, and then submitting the
form.

Upon submitting, the data name/value pair gets sent to the server. In
this instance, the string will be text=usertext, where "usertext" is the
text entered by the user, encoded to preserve special characters. Where
and how the data is submitted depends on the configuration of the
<form>; see Sending form data for more details.

Adding a keyboard shortcut to a submit button

Keyboard shortcuts, also known as access keys and keyboard equivalents,
let the user trigger a button using a key or combination of keys on the
keyboard. To add a keyboard shortcut to a submit button — just as you
would with any <input> for which it makes sense — you use the accesskey
global attribute.

In this example, s is specified as the access key (you'll need to press
s plus the particular modifier keys for your browser/OS combination). In
order to avoid conflicts with the user agent's own keyboard shortcuts,
different modifier keys are used for access keys than for other
shortcuts on the host computer. See accesskey for further details.

Here's the previous example with the s access key added:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="example">Let's submit some text</label>
        <input id="example" type="text" name="text" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Send" accesskey="s" />
      </div>
    </form>

For example, in Firefox for Mac, pressing Control-Option-S triggers the
Send button, while Chrome on Windows uses Alt+S.

The problem with the above example is that the user will not know what
the access key is! This is especially true since the modifiers are
typically non-standard to avoid conflicts. When building a site, be sure
to provide this information in a way that doesn't interfere with the
site design (for example by providing an easily accessible link that
points to information on what the site access keys are). Adding a
tooltip to the button (using the title attribute) can also help,
although it's not a complete solution for accessibility purposes.

Disabling and enabling a submit button

To disable a submit button, specify the disabled attribute on it, like
so:

html

    <input type="submit" value="Send" disabled />

You can enable and disable buttons at run time by setting disabled to
true or false; in JavaScript this looks like btn.disabled = true or
btn.disabled = false.

Note: See the <input type="button"> page for more ideas about enabling
and disabling buttons.

Validation

Submit buttons don't participate in constraint validation; they have no
real value to be constrained.

Examples

We've included simple examples above. There isn't really anything more
to say about submit buttons. There's a reason this kind of control is
sometimes called a "simple button."

# <input type="tel">#

<input> elements of type tel are used to let the user enter and edit a
telephone number. Unlike <input type="email"> and <input type="url">,
the input value is not automatically validated to a particular format
before the form can be submitted, because formats for telephone numbers
vary so much around the world.

Despite the fact that inputs of type tel are functionally identical to
standard text inputs, they do serve useful purposes; the most quickly
apparent of these is that mobile browsers — especially on mobile phones
— may opt to present a custom keypad optimized for entering phone
numbers. Using a specific input type for telephone numbers also makes
adding custom validation and handling of phone numbers more convenient.

Note: Browsers that don't support type tel fall back to being a standard
text input.

Value

The <input> element's value attribute contains a string that either
represents a telephone number or is an empty string ("").

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes that operate on all <input> elements
regardless of their type, telephone number inputs support the following
attributes.

list

The values of the list attribute is the id of a <datalist> element
located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of
predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in
the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the
suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not
requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a
different value.

maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the telephone number field. This must be an integer value
of 0 or higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is
specified, the telephone number field has no maximum length. This value
must also be greater than or equal to the value of minlength.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
entered into the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long.

minlength

The minimum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the telephone number field. This must be a non-negative
integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength.
If no minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the
telephone number input has no minimum length.

The telephone number field will fail constraint validation if the length
of the text entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code
units long.

pattern

The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the
input's value must match for the value to pass constraint validation. It
must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp
type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u'
flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the
pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as
ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular
expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

Note: Use the title attribute to specify text that most browsers will
display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the
pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

See Pattern validation below for details and an example.

placeholder

The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the
user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should
be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data,
rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage
returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality (LTR or RTL) but needs
to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use
Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override
directionality within the placeholder; see How to use Unicode controls
for bidi text for more information.

Note: Avoid using the placeholder attribute if you can. It is not as
semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause
unexpected technical issues with your content. See <input> labels for
more information.

readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited
by the user. Its value can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code
directly setting the HTMLInputElement value property.

Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not
have any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

size

The size attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters
wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than
zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may
or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the
resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of
characters, depending on the characters and the font (font settings in
use).

This does not set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into
the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a
time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the
maxlength attribute.

Non-standard attributes

The following non-standard attributes are available to telephone number
input fields. As a general rule, you should avoid using them unless it
can't be helped.

autocorrect

A Safari extension, the autocorrect attribute is a string which
indicates whether to activate automatic correction while the user is
editing this field. Permitted values are:

on

    Enable automatic correction of typos, as well as processing of text
    substitutions if any are configured.

off

    Disable automatic correction and text substitutions.

mozactionhint Deprecated

A Mozilla extension, which provides a hint as to what sort of action
will be taken if the user presses the Enter or Return key while editing
the field.

Deprecated: Use enterkeyhint instead.

Using tel inputs

Telephone numbers are a very commonly collected type of data on the web.
When creating any kind of registration or e-commerce site, for example,
you will likely need to ask the user for a telephone number, whether for
business purposes or for emergency contact purposes. Given how
commonly-entered phone numbers are, it's unfortunate that a "one size
fits all" solution for validating phone numbers is not practical.

Fortunately, you can consider the requirements of your own site and
implement an appropriate level of validation yourself. See Validation,
below, for details.

Custom keyboards

One of the main advantages of <input type="tel"> is that it causes
mobile browsers to display a special keyboard for entering phone
numbers. For example, here's what the keypads look like on a couple of
devices.

[]

A simple tel input

In its most basic form, a tel input can be implemented like this:

html

    <label for="telNo">Phone number:</label>
    <input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" />

There is nothing magical going on here. When submitted to the server,
the above input's data would be represented as, for example,
telNo=+12125553151.

Placeholders

Sometimes it's helpful to offer an in-context hint as to what form the
input data should take. This can be especially important if the page
design doesn't offer descriptive labels for each <input>. This is where
placeholders come in. A placeholder is a value that demonstrates the
form the value should take by presenting an example of a valid value,
which is displayed inside the edit box when the element's value is "".
Once data is entered into the box, the placeholder disappears; if the
box is emptied, the placeholder reappears.

Here, we have an tel input with the placeholder 123-4567-8901. Note how
the placeholder disappears and reappears as you manipulate the contents
of the edit field.

html

    <input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" placeholder="123-4567-8901" />

Controlling the input size

You can control not only the physical length of the input box, but also
the minimum and maximum lengths allowed for the input text itself.

Physical input element size

The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the size
attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the input
box can display at a time. In this example, for instance, the tel edit
box is 20 characters wide:

html

    <input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" size="20" />

Element value length

The size is separate from the length limitation on the entered telephone
number. You can specify a minimum length, in characters, for the entered
telephone number using the minlength attribute; similarly, use maxlength
to set the maximum length of the entered telephone number.

The example below creates a 20-character wide telephone number entry
box, requiring that the contents be no shorter than 9 characters and no
longer than 14 characters.

html

    <input
      id="telNo"
      name="telNo"
      type="tel"
      size="20"
      minlength="9"
      maxlength="14" />

Note: The above attributes do affect Validation — the above example's
inputs will count as invalid if the length of the value is less than 9
characters, or more than 14. Most browser won't even let you enter a
value over the max length.

Providing default options

Providing a single default using the value attribute

As always, you can provide a default value for an tel input box by
setting its value attribute:

html

    <input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" value="333-4444-4444" />

Offering suggested values

Taking it a step further, you can provide a list of default phone number
values from which the user can select. To do this, use the list
attribute. This doesn't limit the user to those options, but does allow
them to select commonly-used telephone numbers more quickly. This also
offers hints to autocomplete. The list attribute specifies the ID of a
<datalist> element, which in turn contains one <option> element per
suggested value; each option's value is the corresponding suggested
value for the telephone number entry box.

html

    <label for="telNo">Phone number: </label>
    <input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" list="defaultTels" />

    <datalist id="defaultTels">
      <option value="111-1111-1111"></option>
      <option value="122-2222-2222"></option>
      <option value="333-3333-3333"></option>
      <option value="344-4444-4444"></option>
    </datalist>

With the <datalist> element and its <option>s in place, the browser will
offer the specified values as potential values for the phone number;
this is typically presented as a popup or drop-down menu containing the
suggestions. While the specific user experience may vary from one
browser to another, typically clicking in the edit box presents a
drop-down of the suggested phone numbers. Then, as the user types, the
list is adjusted to show only filtered matching values. Each typed
character narrows down the list until the user makes a selection or
types a custom value.

Here's a screenshot of what that might look like:

[An input box has focus with a blue focus ring. The input has a
drop-down menu showing four phone numbers the user can select.]

Validation

As we've touched on before, it's quite difficult to provide a
one-size-fits-all client-side validation solution for phone numbers. So
what can we do? Let's consider some options.

Warning: HTML form validation is not a substitute for server-side
scripts that ensure the entered data is in the proper format before it
is allowed into the database. It's far too easy for someone to make
adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to
remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to bypass your HTML
entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your
server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could
strike when improperly-formatted data (or data which is too large, is of
the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into your database.

Making telephone numbers required

You can make it so that an empty input is invalid and won't be submitted
to the server using the required attribute. For example, let's use this
HTML:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="telNo">Enter a telephone number (required): </label>
        <input id="telNo" name="telNo" type="tel" required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

And let's include the following CSS to highlight valid entries with a
checkmark and invalid entries with a cross:

css

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
      color: #8b0000;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
      color: #009000;
    }

The output looks like this:

Pattern validation

If you want to further restrict entered numbers so they also have to
conform to a specific pattern, you can use the pattern attribute, which
takes as its value a regular expression that entered values have to
match.

In this example we'll use the same CSS as before, but our HTML is
changed to look like this:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="telNo">
          Enter a telephone number (in the form xxx-xxx-xxxx):
        </label>
        <input
          id="telNo"
          name="telNo"
          type="tel"
          required
          pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
      color: #8b0000;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
      color: #009000;
    }

Notice how the entered value is reported as invalid unless the pattern
xxx-xxx-xxxx is matched; for instance, 41-323-421 won't be accepted.
Neither will 800-MDN-ROCKS. However, 865-555-6502 will be accepted. This
particular pattern is obviously only useful for certain locales — in a
real application you'd probably have to vary the pattern used depending
on the locale of the user.

Examples

In this example, we present a simple interface with a <select> element
that lets the user choose which country they're in, and a set of
<input type="tel"> elements to let them enter each part of their phone
number; there is no reason why you can't have multiple tel inputs.

Each input has a placeholder attribute to show a hint to sighted users
about what to enter into it, a pattern to enforce a specific number of
characters for the desired section, and an aria-label attribute to
contain a hint to be read out to screen reader users about what to enter
into it.

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="country">Choose your country:</label>
        <select id="country" name="country">
          <option>UK</option>
          <option selected>US</option>
          <option>Germany</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Enter your telephone number:</p>
        <span class="areaDiv">
          <input
            id="areaNo"
            name="areaNo"
            type="tel"
            required
            placeholder="Area code"
            pattern="[0-9]{3}"
            aria-label="Area code" />
          <span class="validity"></span>
        </span>
        <span class="number1Div">
          <input
            id="number1"
            name="number1"
            type="tel"
            required
            placeholder="First part"
            pattern="[0-9]{3}"
            aria-label="First part of number" />
          <span class="validity"></span>
        </span>
        <span class="number2Div">
          <input
            id="number2"
            name="number2"
            type="tel"
            required
            placeholder="Second part"
            pattern="[0-9]{4}"
            aria-label="Second part of number" />
          <span class="validity"></span>
        </span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

The JavaScript is relatively simple — it contains an onchange event
handler that, when the <select> value is changed, updates the <input>
element's pattern, placeholder, and aria-label to suit the format of
telephone numbers in that country/territory.

js

    const selectElem = document.querySelector("select");
    const inputElems = document.querySelectorAll("input");

    selectElem.onchange = () => {
      for (let i = 0; i < inputElems.length; i++) {
        inputElems[i].value = "";
      }

      if (selectElem.value === "US") {
        inputElems[2].parentNode.style.display = "inline";

        inputElems[0].placeholder = "Area code";
        inputElems[0].pattern = "[0-9]{3}";

        inputElems[1].placeholder = "First part";
        inputElems[1].pattern = "[0-9]{3}";
        inputElems[1].setAttribute("aria-label", "First part of number");

        inputElems[2].placeholder = "Second part";
        inputElems[2].pattern = "[0-9]{4}";
        inputElems[2].setAttribute("aria-label", "Second part of number");
      } else if (selectElem.value === "UK") {
        inputElems[2].parentNode.style.display = "none";

        inputElems[0].placeholder = "Area code";
        inputElems[0].pattern = "[0-9]{3,6}";

        inputElems[1].placeholder = "Local number";
        inputElems[1].pattern = "[0-9]{4,8}";
        inputElems[1].setAttribute("aria-label", "Local number");
      } else if (selectElem.value === "Germany") {
        inputElems[2].parentNode.style.display = "inline";

        inputElems[0].placeholder = "Area code";
        inputElems[0].pattern = "[0-9]{3,5}";

        inputElems[1].placeholder = "First part";
        inputElems[1].pattern = "[0-9]{2,4}";
        inputElems[1].setAttribute("aria-label", "First part of number");

        inputElems[2].placeholder = "Second part";
        inputElems[2].pattern = "[0-9]{4}";
        inputElems[2].setAttribute("aria-label", "Second part of number");
      }
    };

The example looks like this:

This is an interesting idea, which goes to show a potential solution to
the problem of dealing with international phone numbers. You would have
to extend the example of course to provide the correct pattern for
potentially every country, which would be a lot of work, and there would
still be no foolproof guarantee that the users would enter their numbers
correctly.

It makes you wonder if it is worth going to all this trouble on the
client-side, when you could just let the user enter their number in
whatever format they wanted on the client-side and then validate and
sanitize it on the server. But this choice is yours to make.

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
      color: #8b0000;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
      color: #009000;
    }

Value

The value attribute is a string that contains the current value of the
text entered into the text field. You can retrieve this using the
HTMLInputElement value property in JavaScript.

js

    let theText = myTextInput.value;

If no validation constraints are in place for the input (see Validation
for more details), the value may be an empty string ("").

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes that operate on all <input> elements
regardless of their type, text inputs support the following attributes.

list

The values of the list attribute is the id of a <datalist> element
located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of
predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in
the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the
suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not
requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a
different value.

maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the text input. This must be an integer value of 0 or
higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified,
the text input has no maximum length. This value must also be greater
than or equal to the value of minlength.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
value of the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long.
Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the
user.

minlength

The minimum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the text input. This must be a non-negative integer value
smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no
minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the text input
has no minimum length.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long.
Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the
user.

pattern

The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the
input's value must match for the value to pass constraint validation. It
must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp
type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u'
flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the
pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as
ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular
expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

Note: Use the title attribute to specify text that most browsers will
display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the
pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

See Specifying a pattern for further details and an example.

placeholder

The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the
user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should
be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data,
rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage
returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality (LTR or RTL) but needs
to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use
Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override
directionality within the placeholder; see How to use Unicode controls
for bidi text for more information.

Note: Avoid using the placeholder attribute if you can. It is not as
semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause
unexpected technical issues with your content. See <input> accessibility
concerns for more information.

readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited
by the user. Its value can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code
directly setting the HTMLInputElement value property.

Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not
have any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

size

The size attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters
wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than
zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may
or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the
resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of
characters, depending on the characters and the font (font settings in
use).

This does not set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into
the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a
time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the
maxlength attribute.

spellcheck

spellcheck is a global attribute which is used to indicate whether to
enable spell checking for an element. It can be used on any editable
content, but here we consider specifics related to the use of spellcheck
on <input> elements. The permitted values for spellcheck are:

false

    Disable spell checking for this element.

true

    Enable spell checking for this element.

"" (empty string) or no value

    Follow the element's default behavior for spell checking. This may
    be based upon a parent's spellcheck setting or other factors.

An input field can have spell checking enabled if it doesn't have the
readonly attribute set and is not disabled.

The value returned by reading spellcheck may not reflect the actual
state of spell checking within a control, if the user agent's
preferences override the setting.

Non-standard attributes

The following non-standard attributes are also available on some
browsers. As a general rule, you should avoid using them unless it can't
be helped.

autocorrect

A Safari extension, the autocorrect attribute is a string which
indicates whether to activate automatic correction while the user is
editing this field. Permitted values are:

on

    Enable automatic correction of typos, as well as processing of text
    substitutions if any are configured.

off

    Disable automatic correction and text substitutions.

mozactionhint Deprecated

A Mozilla extension, which provides a hint as to what sort of action
will be taken if the user presses the Enter or Return key while editing
the field.

Deprecated: Use enterkeyhint instead.

Using text inputs

<input> elements of type text create basic, single-line inputs. You
should use them anywhere you want the user to enter a single-line value
and there isn't a more specific input type available for collecting that
value (for example, if it's a date, URL, email, or search term, you've
got better options available).

Basic example

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
        <input type="text" id="uname" name="name" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

This renders like so:

When submitted, the data name/value pair sent to the server will be
name=Chris (if "Chris" was entered as the input value before
submission). You must remember to include name attribute on the <input>
element, otherwise the text field's value won't be included with the
submitted data.

Setting placeholders

You can provide a useful placeholder inside your text input that can
provide a hint as to what to enter by including using the placeholder
attribute. Look at the following example:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="uname"
          name="name"
          placeholder="Lower case, all one word" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

You can see how the placeholder is rendered below:

The placeholder is typically rendered in a lighter color than the
element's foreground color, and automatically vanishes when the user
begins to enter text into the field (or whenever the field has a value
set programmatically by setting its value attribute).

Physical input element size

The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the size
attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the text
input can display at a time. This affects the width of the element,
letting you specify the width in terms of characters rather than pixels.
In this example, for instance, the input is 30 characters wide:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="uname"
          name="name"
          placeholder="Lower case, all one word"
          size="30" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

Validation

<input> elements of type text have no automatic validation applied to
them (since a basic text input needs to be capable of accepting any
arbitrary string), but there are some client-side validation options
available, which we'll discuss below.

Note: HTML form validation is not a substitute for server-scripts that
ensure the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy for
someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the
validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone to
bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server.
If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives,
disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data (or data which is
too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into your
database.

A note on styling

There are useful pseudo-classes available for styling form elements to
help the user see when their values are valid or invalid. These are
:valid and :invalid. In this section, we'll use the following CSS, which
will place a check (tick) mark next to inputs containing valid values,
and a cross (X) next to inputs containing invalid values.

css

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

The technique also requires a <span> element to be placed after the form
element, which acts as a holder for the icons. This was necessary
because some input types on some browsers don't display icons placed
directly after them very well.

Making input required

You can use the required attribute as an easy way of making entering a
value required before form submission is allowed:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
        <input type="text" id="uname" name="name" required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }
    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }
    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }
    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

This renders like so:

If you try to submit the form with no search term entered into it, the
browser will show an error message.

Input value length

You can specify a minimum length (in characters) for the entered value
using the minlength attribute; similarly, use maxlength to set the
maximum length of the entered value, in characters.

The example below requires that the entered value be 4–8 characters in
length.

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="uname"
          name="name"
          required
          size="10"
          placeholder="Username"
          minlength="4"
          maxlength="8" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }
    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }
    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }
    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

This renders like so:

If you try to submit the form with less than 4 characters, you'll be
given an appropriate error message (which differs between browsers). If
you try to enter more than 8 characters, the browser won't let you.

Note: If you specify a minlength but do not specify required, the input
is considered valid, since the user is not required to specify a value.

Specifying a pattern

You can use the pattern attribute to specify a regular expression that
the inputted value must match in order to be considered valid (see
Validating against a regular expression for a simple crash course on
using regular expressions to validate inputs).

The example below restricts the value to 4-8 characters and requires
that it contain only lower-case letters.

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="uname">Choose a username: </label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="uname"
          name="name"
          required
          size="45"
          pattern="[a-z]{4,8}" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
        <p>Usernames must be lowercase and 4-8 characters in length.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    p {
      font-size: 80%;
      color: #999;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

This renders like so:

# <input type="time">#

<input> elements of type time create input fields designed to let the
user easily enter a time (hours and minutes, and optionally seconds).

The control's user interface varies from browser to browser; see Browser
compatibility for further details. In unsupported browsers, the control
degrades gracefully to <input type="text">.

Appearance

Chrome and Opera

In Chrome/Opera the time control is simple, with slots to enter hours
and minutes in 12 or 24-hour format depending on operating system
locale, and up and down arrows to increment and decrement the currently
selected component. In some versions, an "X" button is provided to clear
the control's value.

[12-hour Chrome time input] 12-hour

[24-hour Chrome time input] 24-hour

Firefox

Firefox's time control is very similar to Chrome's, except that it
doesn't have the up and down arrows. It also uses a 12- or 24-hour
format for inputting times, based on system locale. An "X" button is
provided to clear the control's value.

[12-hour Firefox time input] 12-hour

[24-hour Firefox time input] 24-hour

Edge

The Edge time control is somewhat more elaborate, opening up an hour and
minute picker with sliding reels. It, like Chrome, uses a 12- or 24-hour
format for inputting times, based on system locale:

[12-hour Edge time input] 12-hour

[24-hour Edge time input] 24-hour

Value

A string containing the value of the time entered into the input.

Setting the value attribute

You can set a default value for the input by including a valid time in
the value attribute when creating the <input> element, like so:

html

    <label for="appt-time">Choose an appointment time: </label>
    <input id="appt-time" type="time" name="appt-time" value="13:30" />

Setting the value using JavaScript

You can also get and set the time value in JavaScript using the
HTMLInputElement value property, for example:

js

    const timeControl = document.querySelector('input[type="time"]');
    timeControl.value = "15:30";

Time value format

The value of the time input is always in 24-hour format that includes
leading zeros: hh:mm, regardless of the input format, which is likely to
be selected based on the user's locale (or by the user agent). If the
time includes seconds (see Using the step attribute), the format is
always hh:mm:ss. You can learn more about the format of the time value
used by this input type in Time strings.

In this example, you can see the time input's value by entering a time
and seeing how it changes afterward.

First, a look at the HTML. This is simple enough, with the label and
input as we've seen before, but with the addition of a <p> element with
a <span> to display the value of the time input:

html

    <form>
      <label for="startTime">Start time: </label>
      <input type="time" id="startTime" />
      <p>
        Value of the <code>time</code> input:
        <code> "<span id="value">n/a</span>"</code>.
      </p>
    </form>

The JavaScript code adds code to the time input to watch for the input
event, which is triggered every time the contents of an input element
change. When this happens, the contents of the <span> are replaced with
the new value of the input element.

js

    const startTime = document.getElementById("startTime");
    const valueSpan = document.getElementById("value");

    startTime.addEventListener(
      "input",
      () => {
        valueSpan.innerText = startTime.value;
      },
      false,
    );

When a form including a time input is submitted, the value is encoded
before being included in the form's data. The form's data entry for a
time input will always be in the form name=hh%3Amm, or name=hh%3Amm%3Ass
if seconds are included (see Using the step attribute).

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes common to all <input> elements, time
inputs offer the following attributes.

Note: Unlike many data types, time values have a periodic domain,
meaning that the values reach the highest possible value, then wrap back
around to the beginning again. For example, specifying a min of 14:00
and a max of 2:00 means that the permitted time values start at 2:00 PM,
run through midnight to the next day, ending at 2:00 AM. See more in the
making min and max cross midnight section of this article.

list

The values of the list attribute is the id of a <datalist> element
located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of
predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in
the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the
suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not
requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a
different value.

max

A string indicating the latest time to accept, specified in the same
time value format as described above. If the specified string isn't a
valid time, no maximum value is set.

min

A string specifying the earliest time to accept, given in the time value
format described previously. If the value specified isn't a valid time
string, no minimum value is set.

readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited
by the user. Its value can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code
directly setting the HTMLInputElement value property.

Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not
have any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

step

The step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the
value must adhere to, or the special value any, which is described
below. Only values which are equal to the basis for stepping (min if
specified, value otherwise, and an appropriate default value if neither
of those is provided) are valid.

A string value of any means that no stepping is implied, and any value
is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max).

Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping
configuration, the user agent may round to the nearest valid value,
preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally
close options.

For time inputs, the value of step is given in seconds, with a scaling
factor of 1000 (since the underlying numeric value is in milliseconds).
The default value of step is 60, indicating 60 seconds (or 1 minute, or
60,000 milliseconds).

At this time, it's unclear what a value of any means for step when used
with time inputs. This will be updated as soon as that information is
determined.

Using time inputs

Basic uses of time

The simplest use of <input type="time"> involves a basic <input> and
<label> element combination, as seen below:

html

    <form>
      <label for="appt-time">Choose an appointment time: </label>
      <input id="appt-time" type="time" name="appt-time" />
    </form>

Controlling input size

<input type="time"> doesn't support form sizing attributes such as size,
since times are always about the same number of characters long. You'll
have to resort to CSS for sizing needs.

Using the step attribute

You can use the step attribute to vary the amount of time jumped
whenever the time is incremented or decremented (for example, so the
time moves by 10 minutes at a time when clicking the little arrow
widgets).

Note: This property has some strange effects across browsers, so is not
completely reliable.

It takes an integer value that equates to the number of seconds you want
to increment by; the default value is 60 seconds, or one minute. If you
specify a value of less than 60 seconds (1 minute), the time input will
show a seconds input area alongside the hours and minutes:

html

    <form>
      <label for="appt-time">Choose an appointment time: </label>
      <input id="appt-time" type="time" name="appt-time" step="2" />
    </form>

In Chrome and Opera, which are the only browsers to show up/down
iteration arrows, clicking the arrows changes the seconds value by two
seconds, but doesn't affect the hours or minutes. Minutes (or hours) can
only be used for stepping when you specify a number of minutes (or
hours) in seconds, such as 120 for 2 minutes, or 7200 for 2 hours).

In Firefox, there are no arrows, so the step value isn't used. However,
providing it does add the seconds input area adjacent to the minutes
section.

The steps value seems to have no effect in Edge.

Note: Using step seems to cause validation to not work properly (as seen
in the next section).

Validation

By default, <input type="time"> does not apply any validation to entered
values, other than the user agent's interface generally not allowing you
to enter anything other than a time value. This is helpful (assuming the
time input is fully supported by the user agent), but you can't entirely
rely on the value to be a proper time string, since it might be an empty
string (""), which is allowed. It's also possible for the value to look
roughly like a valid time but not be correct, such as 25:05.

Setting maximum and minimum times

You can use the min and max attributes to restrict the valid times that
can be chosen by the user. In the following example we are setting a
minimum time of 12:00 and a maximum time of 18:00:

html

    <form>
      <label for="appt-time">
        Choose an appointment time (opening hours 12:00 to 18:00):
      </label>
      <input id="appt-time" type="time" name="appt-time" min="12:00" max="18:00" />
      <span class="validity"></span>
    </form>

Here's the CSS used in the above example. Here we make use of the :valid
and :invalid CSS properties to style the input based on whether the
current value is valid. We had to put the icons on a <span> next to the
input, not on the input itself, because in Chrome the generated content
is placed inside the form control, and can't be styled or shown
effectively.

css

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

The result here is that:

-   Only times between 12:00 and 18:00 will be seen as valid; times
    outside that range will be denoted as invalid.
-   Depending on what browser you're using, you might find that times
    outside the specified range might not even be selectable in the time
    picker (e.g. Edge).

Making min and max cross midnight

By setting a min attribute greater than the max attribute, the valid
time range will wrap around midnight to produce a valid time range which
crosses midnight. This functionality is not supported by any other input
types. While this feature is in the HTML spec, it is not yet universally
supported. Chrome-based browsers support it starting in version 82 and
Firefox added it in version 76. Safari as of version 14.1 does not
support this. Be prepared for this situation to arise:

js

    const input = document.createElement("input");
    input.type = "time";
    input.min = "23:00";
    input.max = "01:00";
    input.value = "23:59";

    if (input.validity.valid && input.type === "time") {
      // <input type=time> reversed range supported
    } else {
      // <input type=time> reversed range unsupported
    }

Making times required

In addition, you can use the required attribute to make filling in the
time mandatory. As a result, supporting browsers will display an error
if you try to submit a time that is outside the set bounds, or an empty
time field.

Let's look at an example; here we've set minimum and maximum times, and
also made the field required:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="appt-time">
          Choose an appointment time (opening hours 12:00 to 18:00):
        </label>
        <input
          id="appt-time"
          type="time"
          name="appt-time"
          min="12:00"
          max="18:00"
          required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
      </div>
    </form>

If you try to submit the form with an incomplete time (or with a time
outside the set bounds), the browser displays an error. Try playing with
the example now:

Warning: HTML form validation is not a substitute for scripts that
ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy
for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass
the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone
to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your
server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives,
disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or
data which is too large, of the wrong type, and so forth).

Handling browser support

As mentioned, older versions of Safari and a few other, less common,
browsers don't support time inputs natively. In general, otherwise,
support is good — especially on mobile platforms, which tend to have
very nice user interfaces for specifying a time value. For example, the
time picker on Chrome for Android looks like this:

[Phone screen showing modal dialog with 10:21 as a header. The 10 is
fully opaque. The 21 is not. The main area has a circle with the numbers
1 - 12 in a ring, and the number 13 -24 on an inner ring. The number 10
is highlighted with a blue circle. The buttons at the bottom are clear,
cancel, and set.]

Browsers that don't support time inputs gracefully degrade to a text
input, but this creates problems both in terms of consistency of user
interface (the presented control will be different), and data handling.

The second problem is the more serious; as mentioned previously, time
inputs' values are always normalized to the format hh:mm or hh:mm:ss.
With a text input, on the other hand, by default the browser has no idea
of what format the time should be in, and there are multiple ways in
which people write times, such as:

-   3.00 pm
-   3:00pm
-   15:00
-   3 o'clock in the afternoon
-   etc.

One way around this is to put a pattern attribute on your time input.
Even though the time input doesn't use it, the text input fallback will.
For example, try viewing the following demo in a browser that doesn't
support time inputs:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="appt-time">
          Choose an appointment time (opening hours 12:00 to 18:00):
        </label>
        <input
          id="appt-time"
          type="time"
          name="appt-time"
          min="12:00"
          max="18:00"
          required
          pattern="[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
      </div>
    </form>

If you try submitting it, you'll see that non-supporting browsers now
display an error message (and highlight the input as invalid) if your
entry doesn't match the pattern nn:nn, where n is a number from 0 to 9.
Of course, this doesn't stop people from entering invalid times, or
incorrectly formatted times that follow the pattern.

Then there's the problem of the user having no idea exactly what format
the time is expected to be in.

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

The best way to deal with times in forms in a cross-browser way, for the
time being, is to get the user to enter the hours and minutes (and
seconds if required) in separate controls (<select> elements are
popular; see below for an example), or use JavaScript libraries such as
the jQuery timepicker plugin.

Examples

In this example, we create two sets of interface elements for choosing
times: a native picker created with <input type="time">, and a set of
two <select> elements for choosing hours/minutes in older browsers that
don't support the native input.

The HTML looks like so:

html

    <form>
      <div class="nativeTimePicker">
        <label for="appt-time">
          Choose an appointment time (opening hours 12:00 to 18:00):
        </label>
        <input
          id="appt-time"
          type="time"
          name="appt-time"
          min="12:00"
          max="18:00"
          required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <p class="fallbackLabel">
        Choose an appointment time (opening hours 12:00 to 18:00):
      </p>
      <div class="fallbackTimePicker">
        <div>
          <span>
            <label for="hour">Hour:</label>
            <select id="hour" name="hour"></select>
          </span>
          <span>
            <label for="minute">Minute:</label>
            <select id="minute" name="minute"></select>
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </form>

The hour and minutes values for their <select> elements are dynamically
generated.

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

The other part of the code that may be of interest is the feature
detection code — to detect whether the browser supports
<input type="time">, we create a new <input> element, try setting its
type to time, then immediately check what its type is set to —
non-supporting browsers will return text, because the time type falls
back to type text. If <input type="time"> is not supported, we hide the
native picker and show the fallback picker UI (<select>s) instead.

js

    // Define variables
    const nativePicker = document.querySelector(".nativeTimePicker");
    const fallbackPicker = document.querySelector(".fallbackTimePicker");
    const fallbackLabel = document.querySelector(".fallbackLabel");

    const hourSelect = document.querySelector("#hour");
    const minuteSelect = document.querySelector("#minute");

    // Hide fallback initially
    fallbackPicker.style.display = "none";
    fallbackLabel.style.display = "none";

    // Test whether a new time input falls back to a text input or not
    const test = document.createElement("input");

    try {
      test.type = "time";
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e.description);
    }

    // If it does, run the code inside the if () {} block
    if (test.type === "text") {
      // Hide the native picker and show the fallback
      nativePicker.style.display = "none";
      fallbackPicker.style.display = "block";
      fallbackLabel.style.display = "block";

      // Populate the hours and minutes dynamically
      populateHours();
      populateMinutes();
    }

    function populateHours() {
      // Populate the hours <select> with the 6 open hours of the day
      for (let i = 12; i <= 18; i++) {
        const option = document.createElement("option");
        option.textContent = i;
        hourSelect.appendChild(option);
      }
    }

    function populateMinutes() {
      // populate the minutes <select> with the 60 hours of each minute
      for (let i = 0; i <= 59; i++) {
        const option = document.createElement("option");
        option.textContent = i < 10 ? `0${i}` : i;
        minuteSelect.appendChild(option);
      }
    }

    // make it so that if the hour is 18, the minutes value is set to 00
    // — you can't select times past 18:00
    function setMinutesToZero() {
      if (hourSelect.value === "18") {
        minuteSelect.value = "00";
      }
    }

    hourSelect.onchange = setMinutesToZero;
    minuteSelect.onchange = setMinutesToZero;

The input value is automatically validated to ensure that it's either
empty or a properly-formatted URL before the form can be submitted. The
:valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes are automatically applied as
appropriate to visually denote whether the current value of the field is
a valid URL or not.

On browsers that don't support inputs of type url, a url input falls
back to being a standard text input.

Value

The <input> element's value attribute contains a string which is
automatically validated as conforming to URL syntax. More specifically,
there are two possible value formats that will pass validation:

1.  An empty string ("") indicating that the user did not enter a value
    or that the value was removed.
2.  A single properly-formed absolute URL. This doesn't necessarily mean
    the URL address exists, but it is at least formatted correctly. In
    simple terms, this means urlscheme://restofurl.

See Validation for details on how URLs are validated to ensure that
they're formatted properly.

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes that operate on all <input> elements
regardless of their type, url inputs support the following attributes.

list

The values of the list attribute is the id of a <datalist> element
located in the same document. The <datalist> provides a list of
predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in
the list that are not compatible with the type are not included in the
suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not
requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a
different value.

maxlength

The maximum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the url input. This must be an integer value of 0 or
higher. If no maxlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified,
the url input has no maximum length. This value must also be greater
than or equal to the value of minlength.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
value of the field is greater than maxlength UTF-16 code units long.
Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the
user.

minlength

The minimum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user
can enter into the url input. This must be a non-negative integer value
smaller than or equal to the value specified by maxlength. If no
minlength is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the url input
has no minimum length.

The input will fail constraint validation if the length of the text
entered into the field is fewer than minlength UTF-16 code units long.
Constraint validation is only applied when the value is changed by the
user.

pattern

The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the
input's value must match for the value to pass constraint validation. It
must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the RegExp
type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the 'u'
flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the
pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as
ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text.

If the specified pattern is not specified or is invalid, no regular
expression is applied and this attribute is ignored completely.

Note: Use the title attribute to specify text that most browsers will
display as a tooltip to explain what the requirements are to match the
pattern. You should also include other explanatory text nearby.

See the section Pattern validation for details and an example.

placeholder

The placeholder attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the
user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should
be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data,
rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage
returns or line feeds.

If the control's content has one directionality (LTR or RTL) but needs
to present the placeholder in the opposite directionality, you can use
Unicode bidirectional algorithm formatting characters to override
directionality within the placeholder; see How to use Unicode controls
for bidi text for more information.

Note: Avoid using the placeholder attribute if you can. It is not as
semantically useful as other ways to explain your form, and can cause
unexpected technical issues with your content. See <input> labels for
more information.

readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited
by the user. Its value can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code
directly setting the HTMLInputElement value property.

Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not
have any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

size

The size attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters
wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than
zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may
or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the
resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of
characters, depending on the characters and the font (font settings in
use).

This does not set a limit on how many characters the user can enter into
the field. It only specifies approximately how many can be seen at a
time. To set an upper limit on the length of the input data, use the
maxlength attribute.

spellcheck

spellcheck is a global attribute which is used to indicate whether to
enable spell checking for an element. It can be used on any editable
content, but here we consider specifics related to the use of spellcheck
on <input> elements. The permitted values for spellcheck are:

false

    Disable spell checking for this element.

true

    Enable spell checking for this element.

"" (empty string) or no value

    Follow the element's default behavior for spell checking. This may
    be based upon a parent's spellcheck setting or other factors.

An input field can have spell checking enabled if it doesn't have the
readonly attribute set and is not disabled.

The value returned by reading spellcheck may not reflect the actual
state of spell checking within a control, if the user agent's
preferences override the setting.

Non-standard attributes

The following non-standard attributes are also available on some
browsers. As a general rule, you should avoid using them unless it can't
be helped.

autocorrect

A Safari extension, the autocorrect attribute is a string which
indicates whether to activate automatic correction while the user is
editing this field. Permitted values are:

on

    Enable automatic correction of typos, as well as processing of text
    substitutions if any are configured.

off

    Disable automatic correction and text substitutions.

mozactionhint Deprecated

A Mozilla extension, which provides a hint as to what sort of action
will be taken if the user presses the Enter or Return key while editing
the field.

Deprecated: Use enterkeyhint instead.

Using URL inputs

When you create a URL input with the proper type value, url, you get
automatic validation that the entered text is at least in the correct
form to potentially be a legitimate URL. This can help avoid cases in
which the user mistypes their website's address, or provides an invalid
one.

It's important, however, to note that this is not enough to ensure that
the specified text is a URL which actually exists, corresponds to the
user of the site, or is acceptable in any other way. It ensures that the
value of the field is properly formatted to be a URL.

Note: A user can tinker with your HTML behind the scenes, so your site
must not use this validation for any security purposes. You must verify
the URL on the server-side of any transaction in which the provided text
may have any security implications of any kind.

A simple URL input

Currently, all browsers which implement this element implement it as a
standard text input field with basic validation features. In its most
basic form, a URL input can be implemented like this:

html

    <input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" />

Notice that it's considered valid when empty and when a single
validly-formatted URL address is entered, but is otherwise not
considered valid. By adding the required attribute, only properly-formed
URLs are allowed; the input is no longer considered valid when empty.

There is nothing magical going on here. Submitting this form would cause
the following data to be sent to the server:
myURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com. Note how characters are escaped as
necessary.

Placeholders

Sometimes it's helpful to offer an in-context hint as to what form the
input data should take. This can be especially important if the page
design doesn't offer descriptive labels for each <input>. This is where
placeholders come in. A placeholder is a value that demonstrates the
form the value should take by presenting an example of a valid value,
which is displayed inside the edit box when the element's value is "".
Once data is entered into the box, the placeholder disappears; if the
box is emptied, the placeholder reappears.

Here, we have a url input with the placeholder http://www.example.com.
Note how the placeholder disappears and reappears as you manipulate the
contents of the edit field.

html

    <input
      id="myURL"
      name="myURL"
      type="url"
      placeholder="http://www.example.com" />

Controlling the input size

You can control not only the physical length of the input box, but also
the minimum and maximum lengths allowed for the input text itself.

Physical input element size

The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the size
attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the input
box can display at a time. In this example, for instance, the url edit
box is 30 characters wide:

html

    <input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" size="30" />

Element value length

The size is separate from the length limitation on the entered URL
itself. You can specify a minimum length, in characters, for the entered
URL using the minlength attribute; similarly, use maxlength to set the
maximum length of the entered URL. If maxLength exceeds size, the input
box's contents will scroll as needed to show the current selection or
insertion point as the content is manipulated.

The example below creates a 30-character wide URL address entry box,
requiring that the contents be no shorter than 10 characters and no
longer than 80 characters.

html

    <input
      id="myURL"
      name="myURL"
      type="url"
      size="30"
      minlength="10"
      maxlength="80" />

Note: These attributes also affect validation; a value shorter or longer
than the specified minimum/maximum lengths will be classified as
invalid; in addition most browsers will refuse to let the user enter a
value longer than the specified maximum length.

Providing default options

Providing a single default using the value attribute

As always, you can provide a default value for a url input box by
setting its value attribute:

html

    <input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" value="http://www.example.com" />

Offering suggested values

Taking it a step further, you can provide a list of default options from
which the user can select by specifying the list attribute. This doesn't
limit the user to those options, but does allow them to select
commonly-used URLs more quickly. This also offers hints to autocomplete.
The list attribute specifies the ID of a <datalist>, which in turn
contains one <option> element per suggested value; each option's value
is the corresponding suggested value for the URL entry box.

html

    <input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" list="defaultURLs" />

    <datalist id="defaultURLs">
      <option value="https://developer.mozilla.org/"></option>
      <option value="http://www.google.com/"></option>
      <option value="http://www.microsoft.com/"></option>
      <option value="https://www.mozilla.org/"></option>
      <option value="http://w3.org/"></option>
    </datalist>

With the <datalist> element and its <option>s in place, the browser will
offer the specified values as potential values for the URL; this is
typically presented as a popup or drop-down menu containing the
suggestions. While the specific user experience may vary from one
browser to another, typically clicking in the edit box presents a
drop-down of the suggested URLs. Then, as the user types, the list is
adjusted to show only matching values. Each typed character narrows down
the list until the user makes a selection or types a custom value.

Using labels for suggested values

You can opt to include the label attribute on one or all of your
<option> elements to provide textual labels. Some browsers may display
only the labels, while others may display both the label and the URL.

html

    <input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" list="defaultURLs" />

    <datalist id="defaultURLs">
      <option value="https://developer.mozilla.org/" label="MDN Web Docs"></option>
      <option value="http://www.google.com/" label="Google"></option>
      <option value="http://www.microsoft.com/" label="Microsoft"></option>
      <option value="https://www.mozilla.org/" label="Mozilla"></option>
      <option value="http://w3.org/" label="W3C"></option>
    </datalist>

Validation

There are two levels of content validation available for url inputs.
First, there's the standard level of validation offered to all <input>s,
which automatically ensures that the contents meet the requirements to
be a valid URL. But there's also the option to add additional filtering
to ensure that your own specialized needs are met, if you have any.

Warning: HTML form validation is not a substitute for scripts that
ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy
for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass
the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone
to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your
server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives,
disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data (or data which is
too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into your
database.

Basic validation

Browsers that support the url input type automatically provide
validation to ensure that only text that matches the standard format for
URLs is entered into the input box.

The syntax of a URL is fairly intricate. It's defined by WHATWG's URL
Living Standard and is described for newcomers in our article What is a
URL?

Making a URL required

As mentioned earlier, to make a URL entry required before the form can
be submitted (you can't leave the field blank), you just need to include
the required attribute on the input.

html

    <form>
      <input id="myURL" name="myURL" type="url" required />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>

Try submitting the above form with no value entered to see what happens.

Pattern validation

If you need the entered URL to be restricted further than just "any
string that looks like a URL," you can use the pattern attribute to
specify a regular expression the value must match for the value to be
valid.

For example, let's say you're building a support page for employees of
Myco, Inc. which will let them contact their IT department for help if
one of their pages has a problem. In our simplified form, the user needs
to enter the URL of the page that has a problem, and a message
describing what is wrong. But we want the URL to only successfully
validate if the entered URL is in a Myco domain.

Since inputs of type url validate against both the standard URL
validation and the specified pattern, you can implement this easily.
Let's see how:

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="myURL">Enter the problem website address:</label>
        <input
          id="myURL"
          name="myURL"
          type="url"
          required
          pattern=".*\.myco\..*"
          title="The URL must be in a Myco domain" />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="myComment">What is the problem?</label>
        <input id="myComment" name="myComment" type="text" required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
    </form>

First of all, the required attribute is specified, making it mandatory
that a valid URL be provided.

Second, in the url input we set pattern to ".*\.myco\..*". This simple
regular expression requests a string that has any number of characters,
followed by a dot, followed by "myco", followed by a dot, followed by
any number of characters. And because the browser runs both the standard
URL filter and our custom pattern against the specified text, we wind up
with a validation which says "make sure this is a valid URL, and also in
a Myco domain."

This isn't perfect, but it is good enough for this simple demo's
requirements.

It's advisable to use the title attribute along with pattern. If you do,
the title must describe the pattern; it should explain what format the
data should take on, rather than any other information. That's because
the title may be displayed or spoken as part of a validation error
message. For example, the browser might present the message "The entered
text doesn't match the required pattern." followed by your specified
title. If your title is something like "URL", the result would be the
message "The entered text doesn't match the required pattern. URL",
which is not a good user experience.

That's why, instead, we specify the string "The URL must be in a myco
domain". By doing that, the resulting full error message might be
something like "The entered text doesn't match the required pattern. The
URL should be in a myco domain."

Note: If you run into trouble while writing your validation regular
expressions and they're not working properly, check your browser's
console; there may be helpful error messages there to aid you in solving
the problem.

Examples

There's not much else to say about url type inputs; check the Pattern
validation and Using URL inputs sections for numerous examples.

You can also find our pattern validation example on GitHub (see it
running live also).

# <input type="week">#

<input> elements of type week create input fields allowing easy entry of
a year plus the ISO 8601 week number during that year (i.e., week 1 to
52 or 53).

%html-content%

The control's user interface varies from browser to browser;
cross-browser support is currently a bit limited, with only Chrome/Opera
and Microsoft Edge supporting it at this time. In non-supporting
browsers, the control degrades gracefully to function identically to
<input type="text">.

[An input reading 'week 01, 2017'. The background of the 2017 is the
same blue as the focus ring. There are 3 icons in the input: x or clear,
a spinner with small up and down arrows, and a larger down arrow. A
calendar is a pop-up below the input set to January 2017. The first
column of the calendar is the week: 52, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. the full month
calendar is to the right of that. The row with Week 1 and January 2 to 8
is highlighted. On the same line as the month, there are buttons to move
right and left for the next and previous months.]

Value

A string representing the value of the week/year entered into the input.
The format of the date and time value used by this input type is
described in Week strings.

You can set a default value for the input by including a value inside
the value attribute, like so:

html

    <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
    <input id="week" type="week" name="week" value="2017-W01" />

One thing to note is that the displayed format may differ from the
actual value, which is always formatted yyyy-Www. When the above value
is submitted to the server, for example, browsers may display it as
Week 01, 2017, but the submitted value will always look like
week=2017-W01.

You can also get and set the value in JavaScript using the input
element's value property, for example:

js

    const weekControl = document.querySelector('input[type="week"]');
    weekControl.value = "2017-W45";

Additional attributes

In addition to the attributes common to <input> elements, week inputs
offer the following attributes.

max

The latest (time-wise) year and week number, in the string format
discussed in the Value section above, to accept. If the value entered
into the element exceeds this, the element fails constraint validation.
If the value of the max attribute isn't a valid week string, then the
element has no maximum value.

This value must be greater than or equal to the year and week specified
by the min attribute.

min

The earliest year and week to accept. If the value of the element is
less than this, the element fails constraint validation. If a value is
specified for min that isn't a valid week string, the input has no
minimum value.

This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max attribute.

readonly

A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited
by the user. Its value can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code
directly setting the HTMLInputElement value property.

Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, required does not
have any effect on inputs with the readonly attribute also specified.

step

The step attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the
value must adhere to, or the special value any, which is described
below. Only values which are equal to the basis for stepping (min if
specified, value otherwise, and an appropriate default value if neither
of those is provided) are valid.

A string value of any means that no stepping is implied, and any value
is allowed (barring other constraints, such as min and max).

Note: When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping
configuration, the user agent may round to the nearest valid value,
preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally
close options.

For week inputs, the value of step is given in weeks, with a scaling
factor of 604,800,000 (since the underlying numeric value is in
milliseconds). The default value of step is 1, indicating 1week. The
default stepping base is -259,200,000, which is the beginning of the
first week of 1970 ("1970-W01").

At this time, it's unclear what a value of "any" means for step when
used with week inputs. This will be updated as soon as that information
is determined.

Using week inputs

Week inputs sound convenient at first glance, since they provide an easy
UI for choosing weeks, and they normalize the data format sent to the
server, regardless of the user's browser or locale. However, there are
issues with <input type="week"> because browser support is not
guaranteed across all browsers.

We'll look at basic and more complex uses of <input type="week">, then
offer advice on mitigating the browser support issue later on (see
Handling browser support).

Basic uses of week

The simplest use of <input type="week"> involves a basic <input> and
<label> element combination, as seen below:

html

    <form>
      <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
      <input id="week" type="week" name="week" />
    </form>

Controlling input size

<input type="week"> doesn't support form sizing attributes such as size.
You'll have to resort to CSS for sizing needs.

Using the step attribute

You should be able to use the step attribute to vary the number of weeks
jumped whenever they are incremented or decremented, however it doesn't
seem to have any effect on supporting browsers.

Validation

By default, <input type="week"> does not apply any validation to entered
values. The UI implementations generally don't let you specify anything
that isn't a valid week/year, which is helpful, but it's still possible
to submit with the field empty, and you might want to restrict the range
of choosable weeks.

Setting maximum and minimum weeks

You can use the min and max attributes to restrict the valid weeks that
can be chosen by the user. In the following example we are setting a
minimum value of Week 01, 2017 and a maximum value of Week 52, 2017:

html

    <form>
      <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
      <input id="week" type="week" name="week" min="2017-W01" max="2017-W52" />
      <span class="validity"></span>
    </form>

Here's the CSS used in the above example. Here we make use of the :valid
and :invalid CSS properties to style the input based on whether the
current value is valid. We had to put the icons on a <span> next to the
input, not on the input itself, because in Chrome the generated content
is placed inside the form control, and can't be styled or shown
effectively.

css

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

The result here is that only weeks between W01 and W52 in 2017 will be
seen as valid and be selectable in supporting browsers.

Making week values required

In addition you can use the required attribute to make filling in the
week mandatory. As a result, supporting browsers will display an error
if you try to submit an empty week field.

Let's look at an example; here we've set minimum and maximum weeks, and
also made the field required:

html

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
        <input
          id="week"
          type="week"
          name="week"
          min="2017-W01"
          max="2017-W52"
          required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
      </div>
    </form>

If you try to submit the form with no value, the browser displays an
error. Try playing with the example now:

Here is a screenshot for those of you who aren't using a supporting
browser:

[The week form control has two dashes where the week number should be. A
popup with a yellow warning symbol and a 'Please fill out this field' is
emanating from the two dashes, which are highlighted in blue, the same
blue as the input's focus ring.]

Warning: HTML form validation is not a substitute for scripts that
ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It's far too easy
for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass
the validation, or to remove it entirely. It's also possible for someone
to bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your
server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives,
disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or
data which is too large, of the wrong type, and so forth).

Handling browser support

As mentioned above, the major problem with using week inputs right now
is browser support: Safari and Firefox don't support it on desktop, and
old versions of IE don't support it.

Mobile platforms such as Android and iOS make perfect use of such input
types, providing specialist UI controls that make it really easy to
select values in a touchscreen environment. For example, the week picker
on Chrome for Android looks like this:

[A modal popup. The header reads 'set week'. There are two columns: the
left has 36 in the middle at full opacity, with 35 above it and 37 below
being semi-opaque. On the right side, 2017 is fully opaque. There are no
other options. Three text links or buttons on the bottom include 'clear'
on the 'left' and 'cancel' and 'set' on the right.]

Non-supporting browsers gracefully degrade to a text input, but this
creates problems both in terms of consistency of user interface (the
presented control will be different), and data handling.

The second problem is the more serious. As mentioned earlier, with a
week input the actual value is always normalized to the format yyyy-Www.
When the browser falls back to a generic text input, there's nothing to
guide the user toward correctly formatting the input (and it's certainly
not intuitive). There are multiple ways in which people could write week
values; for example:

-   Week 1 2017
-   Jan 2-8 2017
-   2017-W01
-   etc.

The best way to deal with week/years in forms in a cross-browser way at
the moment is to get the user to enter the week number and year in
separate controls (<select> elements being popular; see below for an
example), or use JavaScript libraries such as jQuery date picker.

Examples

In this example we create two sets of UI elements for choosing weeks: a
native picker created using <input type="week">, and a set of two
<select> elements for choosing weeks/years in older browsers that don't
support the week input type.

The HTML looks like so:

html

    <form>
      <div class="nativeWeekPicker">
        <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
        <input
          id="week"
          type="week"
          name="week"
          min="2017-W01"
          max="2018-W52"
          required />
        <span class="validity"></span>
      </div>
      <p class="fallbackLabel">What week would you like to start?</p>
      <div class="fallbackWeekPicker">
        <div>
          <span>
            <label for="week">Week:</label>
            <select id="fallbackWeek" name="week"></select>
          </span>
          <span>
            <label for="year">Year:</label>
            <select id="year" name="year">
              <option value="2017" selected>2017</option>
              <option value="2018">2018</option>
            </select>
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </form>

The week values are dynamically generated by the JavaScript code below.

    div {
      margin-bottom: 10px;
      position: relative;
    }

    input[type="number"] {
      width: 100px;
    }

    input + span {
      padding-right: 30px;
    }

    input:invalid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✖";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

    input:valid + span::after {
      position: absolute;
      content: "✓";
      padding-left: 5px;
    }

The other part of the code that may be of interest is the feature
detection code. To detect whether the browser supports
<input type="week">, we create a new <input> element, try setting its
type to week, then immediately check what its type is set to.
Non-supporting browsers will return text, because the week type falls
back to type text. If <input type="week"> is not supported, we hide the
native picker and show the fallback picker UI (<select>s) instead.

js

    // Get UI elements
    const nativePicker = document.querySelector(".nativeWeekPicker");
    const fallbackPicker = document.querySelector(".fallbackWeekPicker");
    const fallbackLabel = document.querySelector(".fallbackLabel");

    const yearSelect = document.querySelector("#year");
    const weekSelect = document.querySelector("#fallbackWeek");

    // Hide fallback initially
    fallbackPicker.style.display = "none";
    fallbackLabel.style.display = "none";

    // Test whether a new date input falls back to a text input or not
    const test = document.createElement("input");

    try {
      test.type = "week";
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e.description);
    }

    // If it does, run the code inside the if () {} block
    if (test.type === "text") {
      // Hide the native picker and show the fallback
      nativePicker.style.display = "none";
      fallbackPicker.style.display = "block";
      fallbackLabel.style.display = "block";

      // populate the weeks dynamically
      populateWeeks();
    }

    function populateWeeks() {
      // Populate the week select with 52 weeks
      for (let i = 1; i <= 52; i++) {
        const option = document.createElement("option");
        option.textContent = i < 10 ? `0${i}` : i;
        weekSelect.appendChild(option);
      }
    }

Note: Remember that some years have 53 weeks in them (see Weeks per
year)! You'll need to take this into consideration when developing
production apps.

cite

    This attribute defines the URI of a resource that explains the
    change, such as a link to meeting minutes or a ticket in a
    troubleshooting system.

datetime

    This attribute indicates the time and date of the change and must be
    a valid date with an optional time string. If the value cannot be
    parsed as a date with an optional time string, the element does not
    have an associated timestamp. For the format of the string without a
    time, see Format of a valid date string. The format of the string if
    it includes both date and time is covered in Format of a valid local
    date and time string.

Examples

html

    <ins>This text has been inserted</ins>

Result

Accessibility concerns

The presence of the <ins> element is not announced by most screen
reading technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be
announced by using the CSS content property, along with the ::before and
::after pseudo-elements.

css

    ins::before,
    ins::after {
      clip-path: inset(100%);
      clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
      height: 1px;
      overflow: hidden;
      position: absolute;
      white-space: nowrap;
      width: 1px;
    }

    ins::before {
      content: " [insertion start] ";
    }

    ins::after {
      content: " [insertion end] ";
    }

Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing
content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important
to not abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not
knowing content has been inserted would adversely affect understanding.

# <kbd>: The Keyboard Input element#

The <kbd> HTML element represents a span of inline text denoting textual
user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device.
By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a
<kbd> element using its default monospace font, although this is not
mandated by the HTML standard.

<kbd> may be nested in various combinations with the <samp> (Sample
Output) element to represent various forms of input or output based on
visual cues.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

Other elements can be used in tandem with <kbd> to represent more
specific scenarios:

-   Nesting a <kbd> element within another <kbd> element represents an
    actual key or other unit of input as a portion of a larger input.
    See Representing keystrokes within an input below.
-   Nesting a <kbd> element inside a <samp> element represents input
    that has been echoed back to the user by the system. See Echoed
    input, below, for an example.
-   Nesting a <samp> element inside a <kbd> element, on the other hand,
    represents input which is based on text presented by the system,
    such as the names of menus and menu items, or the names of buttons
    displayed on the screen. See the example under Representing onscreen
    input options below.

Note: You can define a custom style to override the browser's default
font selection for the <kbd> element, although the user's preferences
may potentially override your CSS.

Examples

Basic example

html

    <p>
      Use the command <kbd>help mycommand</kbd> to view documentation for the
      command "mycommand".
    </p>

Result

Representing keystrokes within an input

To describe an input comprised of multiple keystrokes, you can nest
multiple <kbd> elements, with an outer <kbd> element representing the
overall input and each individual keystroke or component of the input
enclosed within its own <kbd>.

Unstyled

First, let's look at what this looks like as just plain HTML.

HTML

html

    <p>
      You can also create a new document using the
      <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd> keyboard shortcut.
    </p>

This wraps the entire key sequence in an outer <kbd> element, then each
individual key within its own, in order to denote the components of the
sequence.

Note: You don't need to do all this wrapping; you can choose to simplify
it by leaving out the external <kbd> element. In other words,
simplifying this to just <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> would be perfectly
valid.

Note: Depending on your style sheet, though, you may find it useful to
do this kind of nesting.

Result

The output looks like this without a style sheet applied:

With custom styles

We can make more sense of this by adding some CSS:

CSS

We add a new selector for nested <kbd> elements, kbd>kbd, which we can
apply when rendering keyboard keys:

css

    kbd > kbd {
      border-radius: 3px;
      padding: 1px 2px 0;
      border: 1px solid black;
    }

HTML

Then we update the HTML to use this class on the keys in the output to
be presented:

html

    <p>
      You can also create a new document by pressing the
      <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd> shortcut.
    </p>

Result

The result is just what we want!

Echoed input

Nesting a <kbd> element inside a <samp> element represents input that
has been echoed back to the user by the system.

html

    <p>
      If a syntax error occurs, the tool will output the initial command you typed
      for your review:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <samp><kbd>custom-git ad my-new-file.cpp</kbd></samp>
    </blockquote>

Result

Representing onscreen input options

Nesting a <samp> element inside a <kbd> element represents input which
is based on text presented by the system, such as the names of menus and
menu items, or the names of buttons displayed on the screen.

For example, you can explain how to choose the "New Document" option in
the "File" menu using HTML that looks like this:

html

    <p>
      To create a new file, choose the <kbd><kbd><samp>File</samp></kbd>
      ⇒<kbd><samp>New Document</samp></kbd></kbd> menu option.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't forget to click the <kbd><samp>OK</samp></kbd> button to confirm once
      you've entered the name of the new file.
    </p>

This does some interesting nesting. For the menu option description, the
entire input is enclosed in a <kbd> element. Then, inside that, both the
menu and menu item names are contained within both <kbd> and <samp>,
indicating an input which is selected from a screen widget.

Associating a <label> with a form control, such as <input> or <textarea>
offers some major advantages:

-   The label text is not only visually associated with its
    corresponding text input; it is programmatically associated with it
    too. This means that, for example, a screen reader will read out the
    label when the user is focused on the form input, making it easier
    for an assistive technology user to understand what data should be
    entered.
-   When a user clicks or touches/taps a label, the browser passes the
    focus to its associated input (the resulting event is also raised
    for the input). That increased hit area for focusing the input
    provides an advantage to anyone trying to activate it — including
    those using a touch-screen device.

To explicitly associate a <label> element with an <input> element, you
first need to add the id attribute to the <input> element. Next, you add
the for attribute to the <label> element, where the value of for is the
same as the id in the <input> element.

Alternatively, you can nest the <input> directly inside the <label>, in
which case the for and id attributes are not needed because the
association is implicit:

html

    <label>
      Do you like peas?
      <input type="checkbox" name="peas" />
    </label>

The form control that a label is labeling is called the labeled control
of the label element. Multiple labels can be associated with the same
form control:

html

    <label for="username">Enter your username:</label>
    <input id="username" name="username" type="text" />
    <label for="username">Forgot your username?</label>

Elements that can be associated with a <label> element include <button>,
<input> (except for type="hidden"), <meter>, <output>, <progress>,
<select> and <textarea>.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

for

    The value of the for attribute must be a single id for a labelable
    form-related element in the same document as the <label> element.
    So, any given label element can be associated with only one form
    control.

    Note: To programmatically set the for attribute, use htmlFor.

    The first element in the document with an id attribute matching the
    value of the for attribute is the labeled control for this label
    element — if the element with that id is actually a labelable
    element. If it is not a labelable element, then the for attribute
    has no effect. If there are other elements that also match the id
    value, later in the document, they are not considered.

    Multiple label elements can be given the same value for their for
    attribute; doing so causes the associated form control (the form
    control that for value references) to have multiple labels.

    Note: A <label> element can have both a for attribute and a
    contained control element, as long as the for attribute points to
    the contained control element.

Styling with CSS

There are no special styling considerations for <label> elements —
structurally they are simple inline elements, and so can be styled in
much the same way as a <span> or <a> element. You can apply styling to
them in any way you want, as long as you don't cause the text to become
difficult to read.

Examples

Defining an implicit label

html

    <label>Click me <input type="text" /></label>

Defining an explicit label with the "for" attribute

html

    <label for="username">Click me to focus on the input field</label>
    <input type="text" id="username" />

Accessibility concerns

Interactive content

Don't place interactive elements such as anchors or buttons inside a
label. Doing so makes it difficult for people to activate the form input
associated with the label.

Don't do this:

html

    <label for="tac">
      <input id="tac" type="checkbox" name="terms-and-conditions" />
      I agree to the <a href="terms-and-conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a>
    </label>

Prefer this:

html

    <label for="tac">
      <input id="tac" type="checkbox" name="terms-and-conditions" />
      I agree to the Terms and Conditions
    </label>
    <p>
      <a href="terms-and-conditions.html">Read our Terms and Conditions</a>
    </p>

Headings

Placing heading elements within a <label> interferes with many kinds of
assistive technology, because headings are commonly used as a navigation
aid. If the label's text needs to be adjusted visually, use CSS classes
applied to the <label> element instead.

If a form, or a section of a form needs a title, use the <legend>
element placed within a <fieldset>.

Don't do this:

html

    <label for="your-name">
      <h3>Your name</h3>
      <input id="your-name" name="your-name" type="text" />
    </label>

Prefer this:

html

    <label class="large-label" for="your-name">
      Your name
      <input id="your-name" name="your-name" type="text" />
    </label>

Buttons

An <input> element with a type="button" declaration and a valid value
attribute does not need a label associated with it. Doing so may
actually interfere with how assistive technology parses the button
input. The same applies for the <button> element.

# <link>: The External Resource Link element#

The <link> HTML element specifies relationships between the current
document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to
link to stylesheets, but is also used to establish site icons (both
"favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile
devices) among other things.

Try it

    <p style="color: blue">The <code>style</code> attribute can override it, though.</p>

Output

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

To link an external stylesheet, you'd include a <link> element inside
your <head> like this:

html

    <link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet" />

This simple example provides the path to the stylesheet inside an href
attribute, and a rel attribute with a value of stylesheet. The rel
stands for "relationship", and is one of the key features of the <link>
element — the value denotes how the item being linked to is related to
the containing document.

There are a number of other common types you'll come across. For
example, a link to the site's favicon:

html

    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />

There are a number of other icon rel values, mainly used to indicate
special icon types for use on various mobile platforms, e.g.:

html

    <link
      rel="apple-touch-icon"
      sizes="114x114"
      href="apple-icon-114.png"
      type="image/png" />

The sizes attribute indicates the icon size, while the type contains the
MIME type of the resource being linked. These provide useful hints to
allow the browser to choose the most appropriate icon available.

You can also provide a media type or query inside a media attribute;
this resource will then only be loaded if the media condition is true.
For example:

html

    <link href="print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print" />
    <link
      href="mobile.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      media="screen and (max-width: 600px)" />

Some interesting new performance and security features have been added
to the <link> element too. Take this example:

html

    <link
      rel="preload"
      href="myFont.woff2"
      as="font"
      type="font/woff2"
      crossorigin="anonymous" />

A rel value of preload indicates that the browser should preload this
resource (see rel="preload" for more details), with the as attribute
indicating the specific class of content being fetched. The crossorigin
attribute indicates whether the resource should be fetched with a CORS
request.

Other usage notes:

-   A <link> element can occur either in the <head> or <body> element,
    depending on whether it has a link type that is body-ok. For
    example, the stylesheet link type is body-ok, and therefore
    <link rel="stylesheet"> is permitted in the body. However, this
    isn't a good practice to follow; it makes more sense to separate
    your <link> elements from your body content, putting them in the
    <head>.
-   When using <link> to establish a favicon for a site, and your site
    uses a Content Security Policy (CSP) to enhance its security, the
    policy applies to the favicon. If you encounter problems with the
    favicon not loading, verify that the Content-Security-Policy
    header's img-src directive is not preventing access to it.
-   The HTML and XHTML specifications define event handlers for the
    <link> element, but it is unclear how they would be used.
-   Under XHTML 1.0, void elements such as <link> require a trailing
    slash: <link />.
-   WebTV supports the use of the value next for rel to preload the next
    page in a document series.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

as

    This attribute is required when rel="preload" has been set on the
    <link> element, optional when rel="modulepreload" has been set, and
    otherwise should not be used. It specifies the type of content being
    loaded by the <link>, which is necessary for request matching,
    application of correct content security policy, and setting of
    correct Accept request header.

    Furthermore, rel="preload" uses this as a signal for request
    prioritization. The table below lists the valid values for this
    attribute and the elements or resources they apply to.

blocking Experimental

    This attribute explicitly indicates that certain operations should
    be blocked on the fetching of an external resource. The operations
    that are to be blocked must be a space-separated list of blocking
    attributes listed below.

    -   render: The rendering of content on the screen is blocked.

crossorigin

    This enumerated attribute indicates whether CORS must be used when
    fetching the resource. CORS-enabled images can be reused in the
    <canvas> element without being tainted. The allowed values are:

    anonymous

        A cross-origin request (i.e. with an Origin HTTP header) is
        performed, but no credential is sent (i.e. no cookie, X.509
        certificate, or HTTP Basic authentication). If the server does
        not give credentials to the origin site (by not setting the
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header) the resource will be
        tainted and its usage restricted.

    use-credentials

        A cross-origin request (i.e. with an Origin HTTP header) is
        performed along with a credential sent (i.e. a cookie,
        certificate, and/or HTTP Basic authentication is performed). If
        the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials HTTP header), the resource will
        be tainted and its usage restricted.

    If the attribute is not present, the resource is fetched without a
    CORS request (i.e. without sending the Origin HTTP header),
    preventing its non-tainted usage. If invalid, it is handled as if
    the enumerated keyword anonymous was used. See CORS settings
    attributes for additional information.

disabled Non-standard

    For rel="stylesheet" only, the disabled Boolean attribute indicates
    whether the described stylesheet should be loaded and applied to the
    document. If disabled is specified in the HTML when it is loaded,
    the stylesheet will not be loaded during page load. Instead, the
    stylesheet will be loaded on-demand, if and when the disabled
    attribute is changed to false or removed.

    Setting the disabled property in the DOM causes the stylesheet to be
    removed from the document's Document.styleSheets list.

fetchpriority

    Provides a hint of the relative priority to use when fetching a
    preloaded resource. Allowed values:

    high

        Signals a high-priority fetch relative to other resources of the
        same type.

    low

        Signals a low-priority fetch relative to other resources of the
        same type.

    auto

        Default: Signals automatic determination of fetch priority
        relative to other resources of the same type.

href

    This attribute specifies the URL of the linked resource. A URL can
    be absolute or relative.

hreflang

    This attribute indicates the language of the linked resource. It is
    purely advisory. Allowed values are specified by RFC 5646: Tags for
    Identifying Languages (also known as BCP 47). Use this attribute
    only if the href attribute is present.

imagesizes

    For rel="preload" and as="image" only, the imagesizes attribute is a
    sizes attribute that indicates to preload the appropriate resource
    used by an img element with corresponding values for its srcset and
    sizes attributes.

imagesrcset

    For rel="preload" and as="image" only, the imagesrcset attribute is
    a sourceset attribute that indicates to preload the appropriate
    resource used by an img element with corresponding values for its
    srcset and sizes attributes.

integrity

    Contains inline metadata — a base64-encoded cryptographic hash of
    the resource (file) you're telling the browser to fetch. The browser
    can use this to verify that the fetched resource has been delivered
    free of unexpected manipulation. See Subresource Integrity.

media

    This attribute specifies the media that the linked resource applies
    to. Its value must be a media type / media query. This attribute is
    mainly useful when linking to external stylesheets — it allows the
    user agent to pick the best adapted one for the device it runs on.

referrerpolicy

    A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the
    resource:

    -   no-referrer means that the Referer header will not be sent.
    -   no-referrer-when-downgrade means that no Referer header will be
        sent when navigating to an origin without TLS (HTTPS). This is a
        user agent's default behavior, if no policy is otherwise
        specified.
    -   origin means that the referrer will be the origin of the page,
        which is roughly the scheme, the host, and the port.
    -   origin-when-cross-origin means that navigating to other origins
        will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port, while
        navigating on the same origin will include the referrer's path.
    -   unsafe-url means that the referrer will include the origin and
        the path (but not the fragment, password, or username). This
        case is unsafe because it can leak origins and paths from
        TLS-protected resources to insecure origins.

rel

    This attribute names a relationship of the linked document to the
    current document. The attribute must be a space-separated list of
    link type values.

sizes

    This attribute defines the sizes of the icons for visual media
    contained in the resource. It must be present only if the rel
    contains a value of icon or a non-standard type such as Apple's
    apple-touch-icon. It may have the following values:

    -   any, meaning that the icon can be scaled to any size as it is in
        a vector format, like image/svg+xml.
    -   a white-space separated list of sizes, each in the format
        <width in pixels>x<height in pixels> or
        <width in pixels>X<height in pixels>. Each of these sizes must
        be contained in the resource.

    Note: Most icon formats are only able to store one single icon;
    therefore, most of the time, the sizes attribute contains only one
    entry. MS's ICO format does, as well as Apple's ICNS. ICO is more
    ubiquitous, so you should use this format if cross-browser support
    is a concern (especially for old IE versions).

title

    The title attribute has special semantics on the <link> element.
    When used on a <link rel="stylesheet"> it defines a default or an
    alternate stylesheet.

type

    This attribute is used to define the type of the content linked to.
    The value of the attribute should be a MIME type such as text/html,
    text/css, and so on. The common use of this attribute is to define
    the type of stylesheet being referenced (such as text/css), but
    given that CSS is the only stylesheet language used on the web, not
    only is it possible to omit the type attribute, but is actually now
    recommended practice. It is also used on rel="preload" link types,
    to make sure the browser only downloads file types that it supports.

Non-standard attributes

methods Non-standard Deprecated

    The value of this attribute provides information about the functions
    that might be performed on an object. The values generally are given
    by the HTTP protocol when it is used, but it might (for similar
    reasons as for the title attribute) be useful to include advisory
    information in advance in the link. For example, the browser might
    choose a different rendering of a link as a function of the methods
    specified; something that is searchable might get a different icon,
    or an outside link might render with an indication of leaving the
    current site. This attribute is not well understood nor supported,
    even by the defining browser, Internet Explorer 4.

target Deprecated

    Defines the frame or window name that has the defined linking
    relationship or that will show the rendering of any linked resource.

Obsolete attributes

charset Deprecated

    This attribute defines the character encoding of the linked
    resource. The value is a space- and/or comma-delimited list of
    character sets as defined in RFC 2045. The default value is
    iso-8859-1.

    Note: To produce the same effect as this obsolete attribute, use the
    Content-Type HTTP header on the linked resource.

rev Deprecated

    The value of this attribute shows the relationship of the current
    document to the linked document, as defined by the href attribute.
    The attribute thus defines the reverse relationship compared to the
    value of the rel attribute. Link type values for the attribute are
    similar to the possible values for rel.

    Note: Instead of rev, you should use the rel attribute with the
    opposite link type value. For example, to establish the reverse link
    for made, specify author. Also, this attribute doesn't stand for
    "revision" and must not be used with a version number, even though
    many sites misuse it in this way.

Examples

Including a stylesheet

To include a stylesheet in a page, use the following syntax:

html

    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />

Providing alternative stylesheets

You can also specify alternative style sheets.

The user can choose which style sheet to use by choosing it from the
View > Page Style menu. This provides a way for users to see multiple
versions of a page.

html

    <link href="default.css" rel="stylesheet" title="Default Style" />
    <link href="fancy.css" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="Fancy" />
    <link href="basic.css" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="Basic" />

Providing icons for different usage contexts

You can include links to several icons on the same page, and the browser
will choose which one works best for its particular context using the
rel and sizes values as hints.

html

    <!-- third-generation iPad with high-resolution Retina display: -->
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="144x144" href="favicon144.png" />
    <!-- iPhone with high-resolution Retina display: -->
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="114x114" href="favicon114.png" />
    <!-- first- and second-generation iPad: -->
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="72x72" href="favicon72.png" />
    <!-- non-Retina iPhone, iPod Touch, and Android 2.1+ devices: -->
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="favicon57.png" />
    <!-- basic favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon32.png" />

Conditionally loading resources with media queries

You can provide a media type or query inside a media attribute; this
resource will then only be loaded if the media condition is true. For
example:

html

    <link href="print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print" />
    <link href="mobile.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" />
    <link
      href="desktop.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      media="screen and (min-width: 600px)" />
    <link
      href="highres.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      media="screen and (min-resolution: 300dpi)" />

Stylesheet load events

You can determine when a style sheet has been loaded by watching for a
load event to fire on it; similarly, you can detect if an error has
occurred while processing a style sheet by watching for an error event:

html

    <script>
      const stylesheet = document.querySelector("#my-stylesheet");

      stylesheet.onload = () => {
        // Do something interesting; the sheet has been loaded
      };

      stylesheet.onerror = () => {
        console.log("An error occurred loading the stylesheet!");
      };
    </script>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystylesheet.css" id="my-stylesheet" />

Note: The load event fires once the stylesheet and all of its imported
content has been loaded and parsed, and immediately before the styles
start being applied to the content.

Preload examples

You can find a number of <link rel="preload"> examples in Preloading
content with rel="preload".

Blocking rendering till a resource is fetched

You can include render token inside a blocking attribute; the rendering
of the page will be blocked till the resource is fetched. For example:

html

    <link
      blocking="render"
      rel="preload"
      href="critical-font.woff2"
      as="font"
      crossorigin />

# <main>: The Main element#

The <main> HTML element represents the dominant content of the <body> of
a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly
related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the
central functionality of an application.

Attributes

Usage notes

The content of a <main> element should be unique to the document.
Content that is repeated across a set of documents or document sections
such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos,
and search forms shouldn't be included unless the search form is the
main function of the page.

<main> doesn't contribute to the document's outline; that is, unlike
elements such as <body>, headings such as h2, and such, <main> doesn't
affect the DOM's concept of the structure of the page. It's strictly
informative.

Examples

html

    <!-- other content -->

    <main>
      <h1>Apples</h1>
      <p>The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree.</p>

      <article>
        <h2>Red Delicious</h2>

          These bright red apples are the most common found in many supermarkets.

      <article>

Accessibility concerns

Landmark

The <main> element behaves like a main landmark role. Landmarks can be
used by assistive technology to quickly identify and navigate to large
sections of the document. Prefer using the <main> element over declaring
role="main", unless there are legacy browser support concerns.

Skip navigation

Skip navigation, also known as "skipnav", is a technique that allows an
assistive technology user to quickly bypass large sections of repeated
content (main navigation, info banners, etc.). This lets the user access
the main content of the page faster.

Adding an id attribute to the <main> element lets it be a target of a
skip navigation link.

html

    <body>
      <a href="#main-content">Skip to main content</a>

      <!-- navigation and header content -->

      <main id="main-content">
        <!-- main page content -->
      </main>
    </body>

-   WebAIM: "Skip Navigation" Links

Reader mode

Browser reader mode functionality looks for the presence of the <main>
element, as well as heading and content sectioning elements when
converting content into a specialized reader view.

name

    The name attribute gives the map a name so that it can be
    referenced. The attribute must be present and must have a non-empty
    value with no space characters. The value of the name attribute must
    not be equal to the value of the name attribute of another <map>
    element in the same document. If the id attribute is also specified,
    both attributes must have the same value.

# <mark>: The Mark Text element#

The <mark> HTML element represents text which is marked or highlighted
for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance
in the enclosing context.

Attributes

Usage notes

Typical use cases for <mark> include:

-   When used in a quotation (<q>) or block quote (<blockquote>), it
    generally indicates text which is of special interest but is not
    marked in the original source material, or material which needs
    special scrutiny even though the original author didn't think it was
    of particular importance. Think of this like using a highlighter pen
    in a book to mark passages that you find of interest.
-   Otherwise, <mark> indicates a portion of the document's content
    which is likely to be relevant to the user's current activity. This
    might be used, for example, to indicate the words that matched a
    search operation.
-   Don't use <mark> for syntax highlighting purposes; instead, use the
    <span> element with appropriate CSS applied to it.

Note: Don't confuse <mark> with the <strong> element; <mark> is used to
denote content which has a degree of relevance, while <strong> indicates
spans of text of importance.

Examples

Marking text of interest

In this first example, a <mark> element is used to mark some text within
a quote which is of particular interest to the user.

html

    <blockquote>
      It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base,
      have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the
      battle, <mark>Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans</mark> to the Empire's
      ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to
      destroy an entire planet.
    </blockquote>

Result

Identifying context-sensitive passages

This example demonstrates using <mark> to mark search results within a
passage.

html

    <p>
      It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been
      destroyed, <mark class="match">Imperial</mark> troops have driven the Rebel
      forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Evading the dreaded <mark class="match">Imperial</mark> Starfleet, a group of
      freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker has established a new secret base on
      the remote ice world of Hoth.
    </p>

To help distinguish the use of <mark> for search results from other
potential usage, this example applies the custom class "match" to each
match.

Result

Accessibility concerns

The presence of the mark element is not announced by most screen reading
technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be announced
by using the CSS content property, along with the ::before and ::after
pseudo-elements.

css

    mark::before,
    mark::after {
      clip-path: inset(100%);
      clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
      height: 1px;
      overflow: hidden;
      position: absolute;
      white-space: nowrap;
      width: 1px;
    }

    mark::before {
      content: " [highlight start] ";
    }

    mark::after {
      content: " [highlight end] ";
    }

Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing
content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important
to not abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not
knowing content has been highlighted would adversely affect
understanding.

# <marquee>: The Marquee element#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <marquee> HTML element is used to insert a scrolling area of text.
You can control what happens when the text reaches the edges of its
content area using its attributes.

Attributes

behavior Deprecated

    Sets how the text is scrolled within the marquee. Possible values
    are scroll, slide and alternate. If no value is specified, the
    default value is scroll.

bgcolor Deprecated

    Sets the background color through color name or hexadecimal value.

direction Deprecated

    Sets the direction of the scrolling within the marquee. Possible
    values are left, right, up and down. If no value is specified, the
    default value is left.

height Deprecated

    Sets the height in pixels or percentage value.

hspace Deprecated

    Sets the horizontal margin

loop Deprecated

    Sets the number of times the marquee will scroll. If no value is
    specified, the default value is −1, which means the marquee will
    scroll continuously.

scrollamount Deprecated

    Sets the amount of scrolling at each interval in pixels. The default
    value is 6.

scrolldelay Deprecated

    Sets the interval between each scroll movement in milliseconds. The
    default value is 85. Note that any value smaller than 60 is ignored
    and the value 60 is used instead unless truespeed is specified.

truespeed Deprecated

    By default, scrolldelay values lower than 60 are ignored. If
    truespeed is present, those values are not ignored.

vspace Deprecated

    Sets the vertical margin in pixels or percentage value.

width Deprecated

    Sets the width in pixels or percentage value.

Event handlers

onbounce

    Fires when the marquee has reached the end of its scroll position.
    It can only fire when the behavior attribute is set to alternate.

onfinish

    Fires when the marquee has finished the amount of scrolling that is
    set by the loop attribute. It can only fire when the loop attribute
    is set to some number that is greater than 0.

onstart

    Fires when the marquee starts scrolling.

Methods

start()

    Starts scrolling of the marquee.

stop()

    Stops scrolling of the marquee.

Examples

html

    <marquee>This text will scroll from right to left</marquee>

    <marquee direction="up">This text will scroll from bottom to top</marquee>

    <marquee
      direction="down"
      width="250"
      height="200"
      behavior="alternate"
      style="border:solid">
      <marquee behavior="alternate">This text will bounce</marquee>

# <menu>: The Menu element#

The <menu> HTML element is described in the HTML specification as a
semantic alternative to <ul>, but treated by browsers (and exposed
through the accessibility tree) as no different than <ul>. It represents
an unordered list of items (which are represented by <li> elements).

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

The <menu> and <ul> elements both represent an unordered list of items.
The key difference is that <ul> primarily contains items for display,
while <menu> was intended for interactive items. The related <menuitem>
element has been deprecated.

Note: In early versions of the HTML specification, the <menu> element
had an additional use case as a context menu. This functionality is
considered obsolete and is not in the specification.

Examples

Toolbar

In this example, a <menu> is used to create a toolbar for an editing
application.

Note that this is functionally no different from:

# <menuitem>#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

Non-standard: This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards
track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not
work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between
implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

The <menuitem> HTML element represents a command that a user is able to
invoke through a popup menu. This includes context menus, as well as
menus that might be attached to a menu button.

A command can either be defined explicitly, with a textual label and
optional icon to describe its appearance, or alternatively as an
indirect command whose behavior is defined by a separate element.
Commands can also optionally include a checkbox or be grouped to share
radio buttons. (Menu items for indirect commands gain checkboxes or
radio buttons when defined against elements <input type="checkbox"> and
<input type="radio">.)

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes; in particular title can be
used to describe the command, or provide usage hints.

checked Deprecated Non-standard

    Boolean attribute which indicates whether the command is selected.
    May only be used when the type attribute is checkbox or radio.

command Deprecated Non-standard

    Specifies the ID of a separate element, indicating a command to be
    invoked indirectly. May not be used within a menu item that also
    includes the attributes checked, disabled, icon, label, radiogroup
    or type.

default Deprecated Non-standard

    This Boolean attribute indicates use of the same command as the
    menu's subject element (such as a button or input).

disabled Deprecated Non-standard

    Boolean attribute which indicates that the command is not available
    in the current state. Note that disabled is distinct from hidden;
    the disabled attribute is appropriate in any context where a change
    in circumstances might render the command relevant.

icon Deprecated Non-standard

    Image URL, used to provide a picture to represent the command.

label

    The name of the command as shown to the user. Required when a
    command attribute is not present.

radiogroup Deprecated Non-standard

    This attribute specifies the name of a group of commands to be
    toggled as radio buttons when selected. May only be used where the
    type attribute is radio.

type Deprecated Non-standard

    This attribute indicates the kind of command, and can be one of
    three values.

    -   command: A regular command with an associated action. This is
        the missing value default.
    -   checkbox: Represents a command that can be toggled between two
        different states.
    -   radio: Represent one selection from a group of commands that can
        be toggled as radio buttons.

The type of metadata provided by the <meta> element can be one of the
following:

-   If the name attribute is set, the <meta> element provides
    document-level metadata, applying to the whole page.
-   If the http-equiv attribute is set, the <meta> element is a pragma
    directive, providing information equivalent to what can be given by
    a similarly-named HTTP header.
-   If the charset attribute is set, the <meta> element is a charset
    declaration, giving the character encoding in which the document is
    encoded.
-   If the itemprop attribute is set, the <meta> element provides
    user-defined metadata.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

Note: the attribute name has a specific meaning for the <meta> element,
and the itemprop attribute must not be set on the same <meta> element
that has any existing name, http-equiv or charset attributes.

charset

    This attribute declares the document's character encoding. If the
    attribute is present, its value must be an ASCII case-insensitive
    match for the string "utf-8", because UTF-8 is the only valid
    encoding for HTML5 documents. <meta> elements which declare a
    character encoding must be located entirely within the first 1024
    bytes of the document.

content

    This attribute contains the value for the http-equiv or name
    attribute, depending on which is used.

http-equiv

    Defines a pragma directive. The attribute is named http-equiv(alent)
    because all the allowed values are names of particular HTTP headers:

    -   content-security-policy Allows page authors to define a content
        policy for the current page. Content policies mostly specify
        allowed server origins and script endpoints which help guard
        against cross-site scripting attacks.
    -   content-type Declares the MIME type and the document's character
        encoding. The content attribute must have the value
        "text/html; charset=utf-8" if specified. This is equivalent to a
        <meta> element with the charset attribute specified and carries
        the same restriction on placement within the document. Note: Can
        only be used in documents served with a text/html — not in
        documents served with an XML MIME type.
    -   default-style Sets the name of the default CSS style sheet set.
    -   x-ua-compatible If specified, the content attribute must have
        the value "IE=edge". User agents are required to ignore this
        pragma.
    -   refresh This instruction specifies:
        -   The number of seconds until the page should be reloaded -
            only if the content attribute contains a non-negative
            integer.
        -   The number of seconds until the page should redirect to
            another - only if the content attribute contains a
            non-negative integer followed by the string ';url=', and a
            valid URL.

        Warning:

        Pages set with a refresh value run the risk of having the time
        interval being too short. People navigating with the aid of
        assistive technology such as a screen reader may be unable to
        read through and understand the page's content before being
        automatically redirected. The abrupt, unannounced updating of
        the page content may also be disorienting for people
        experiencing low vision conditions.

name

    The name and content attributes can be used together to provide
    document metadata in terms of name-value pairs, with the name
    attribute giving the metadata name, and the content attribute giving
    the value.

The <meta> element can be used to provide document metadata in terms of
name-value pairs, with the name attribute giving the metadata name, and
the content attribute giving the value.

Standard metadata names defined in the HTML specification

The HTML specification defines the following set of standard metadata
names:

-   application-name: the name of the application running in the web
    page.
    Note:

    -   Browsers may use this to identify the application. It is
        different from the <title> element, which usually contain the
        application name, but may also contain information like the
        document name or a status.
    -   Simple web pages shouldn't define an application-name.
-   author: the name of the document's author.
-   description: a short and accurate summary of the content of the
    page. Several browsers, like Firefox and Opera, use this as the
    default description of bookmarked pages.
-   generator: the identifier of the software that generated the page.
-   keywords: words relevant to the page's content separated by commas.
-   referrer: controls the HTTP Referer header of requests sent from the
    document:
      --------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      no-referrer                       Do not send a HTTP Referer header.
      origin                            Send the origin of the document.
      no-referrer-when-downgrade        Send the full URL when the destination is at least as secure as the current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS), but send no referrer when it's less secure (HTTPS→HTTP). This is the default behavior.
      origin-when-cross-origin          Send the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin requests, but only send the origin for other cases.
      same-origin                       Send the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin requests. Cross-origin requests will contain no referrer header.
      strict-origin                     Send the origin when the destination is at least as secure as the current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS), but send no referrer when it's less secure (HTTPS→HTTP).
      strict-origin-when-cross-origin   Send the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin requests. Send the origin when the destination is at least as secure as the current page (HTTP(S)→HTTPS). Otherwise, send no referrer.
      unsafe-URL                        Send the full URL (stripped of parameters) for same-origin or cross-origin requests.
      --------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      : Values for the content attribute of <meta name="referrer">

    Note:

    -   Dynamically inserting <meta name="referrer"> (with
        document.write() or appendChild()) makes the referrer behavior
        unpredictable.
    -   When several conflicting policies are defined, the no-referrer
        policy is applied.
-   theme-color: indicates a suggested color that user agents should use
    to customize the display of the page or of the surrounding user
    interface. The content attribute contains a valid CSS <color>. The
    media attribute with a valid media query list can be included to set
    the media the theme color metadata applies to.
-   color-scheme: specifies one or more color schemes with which the
    document is compatible. The browser will use this information in
    tandem with the user's browser or device settings to determine what
    colors to use for everything from background and foregrounds to form
    controls and scrollbars. The primary use for
    <meta name="color-scheme"> is to indicate compatibility with—and
    order of preference for—light and dark color modes. The value of the
    content property for color-scheme may be one of the following:

    normal

        The document is unaware of color schemes and should be rendered
        using the default color palette.

    [light | dark]+

        One or more color schemes supported by the document. Specifying
        the same color scheme more than once has the same effect as
        specifying it only once. Indicating multiple color schemes
        indicates that the first scheme is preferred by the document,
        but that the second specified scheme is acceptable if the user
        prefers it.

    only light

        Indicates that the document only supports light mode, with a
        light background and dark foreground colors. By specification,
        only dark is not valid, because forcing a document to render in
        dark mode when it isn't truly compatible with it can result in
        unreadable content; all major browsers default to light mode if
        not otherwise configured.

    For example, to indicate that a document prefers dark mode but does
    render functionally in light mode as well:
    html

        <meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light" />

    This works at the document level in the same way that the CSS
    color-scheme property lets individual elements specify their
    preferred and accepted color schemes. Your styles can adapt to the
    current color scheme using the prefers-color-scheme CSS media
    feature.

Standard metadata names defined in other specifications

The CSS Device Adaptation specification defines the following metadata
name:

-   viewport: gives hints about the size of the initial size of the
    viewport.

Other metadata names

The WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page contains a large set of non-standard
metadata names that have not been formally accepted yet; however, some
of the names included there are already used quite commonly in practice
— including the following:

-   creator: the name of the creator of the document, such as an
    organization or institution. If there are more than one, several
    <meta> elements should be used.
-   googlebot, a synonym of robots, is only followed by Googlebot (the
    indexing crawler for Google).
-   publisher: the name of the document's publisher.
-   robots: the behavior that cooperative crawlers, or "robots", should
    use with the page. It is a comma-separated list of the values below:
      Value          Description                                                                   Used by
      -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------
      index          Allows the robot to index the page (default).                                 All
      noindex        Requests the robot to not index the page.                                     All
      follow         Allows the robot to follow the links on the page (default).                   All
      nofollow       Requests the robot to not follow the links on the page.                       All
      all            Equivalent to index, follow                                                   Google
      none           Equivalent to noindex, nofollow                                               Google
      noarchive      Requests the search engine not to cache the page content.                     Google, Yahoo, Bing
      nosnippet      Prevents displaying any description of the page in search engine results.     Google, Bing
      noimageindex   Requests this page not to appear as the referring page of an indexed image.   Google
      nocache        Synonym of noarchive.                                                         Bing

    Note:

    -   Only cooperative robots follow these rules. Do not expect to
        prevent email harvesters with them.
    -   The robot still needs to access the page in order to read these
        rules. To prevent bandwidth consumption, consider if using a
        robots.txt file is more appropriate.
    -   The robots <meta> tag and robots.txt file serve different
        purposes: robots.txt controls the crawling of pages, and does
        not affect indexing or other behavior controlled by robots meta.
        A page that can't be crawled may still be indexed if it is
        referenced by another document.
    -   If you want to remove a page, noindex will work, but only after
        the robot visits the page again. Ensure that the robots.txt file
        is not preventing revisits.
    -   Some values are mutually exclusive, like index and noindex, or
        follow and nofollow. In these cases the robot's behavior is
        undefined and may vary between them.
    -   Some crawler robots, like Google, Yahoo and Bing, support the
        same values for the HTTP header X-Robots-Tag; this allows
        non-HTML documents like images to use these rules.

# theme-color#

The theme-color value for the name attribute of the <meta> element
indicates a suggested color that user agents should use to customize the
display of the page or of the surrounding user interface. If specified,
the content attribute must contain a valid CSS <color>.

Example

html

    <meta name="theme-color" content="#4285f4" />

The following image shows the effect that the <meta> element above will
have on a document displayed in Chrome running on an Android mobile
device.

You can provide a media type or query inside the media attribute; the
color will then only be set if the media condition is true. For example:

html

    <meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="cyan" />
    <meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="black" />

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

value

    The current numeric value. This must be between the minimum and
    maximum values (min attribute and max attribute) if they are
    specified. If unspecified or malformed, the value is 0. If
    specified, but not within the range given by the min attribute and
    max attribute, the value is equal to the nearest end of the range.

    Note: Unless the value attribute is between 0 and 1 (inclusive), the
    min and max attributes should define the range so that the value
    attribute's value is within it.

min

    The lower numeric bound of the measured range. This must be less
    than the maximum value (max attribute), if specified. If
    unspecified, the minimum value is 0.

max

    The upper numeric bound of the measured range. This must be greater
    than the minimum value (min attribute), if specified. If
    unspecified, the maximum value is 1.

low

    The upper numeric bound of the low end of the measured range. This
    must be greater than the minimum value (min attribute), and it also
    must be less than the high value and maximum value (high attribute
    and max attribute, respectively), if any are specified. If
    unspecified, or if less than the minimum value, the low value is
    equal to the minimum value.

high

    The lower numeric bound of the high end of the measured range. This
    must be less than the maximum value (max attribute), and it also
    must be greater than the low value and minimum value (low attribute
    and min attribute, respectively), if any are specified. If
    unspecified, or if greater than the maximum value, the high value is
    equal to the maximum value.

optimum

    This attribute indicates the optimal numeric value. It must be
    within the range (as defined by the min attribute and max
    attribute). When used with the low attribute and high attribute, it
    gives an indication where along the range is considered preferable.
    For example, if it is between the min attribute and the low
    attribute, then the lower range is considered preferred. The browser
    may color the meter's bar differently depending on whether the value
    is less than or equal to the optimum value.

form

    This optional attribute is used to explicitly set a <form> owner for
    the <meter> element. If omitted, the <meter> is associated with its
    ancestor <form> element or the form association set by the form
    attribute on another ancestor element, such as on a <fieldset>, if
    any. If included, the value must be the id of a <form> in the same
    tree.

Examples

Simple example

HTML

html

    <p>
      Heat the oven to <meter min="200" max="500" value="350">350 degrees</meter>.
    </p>

Result

On Google Chrome, the resulting meter looks like this:

[A screenshot of the meter element in Google Chrome]

High and Low range example

Note that in this example the min attribute is omitted. This is allowed,
as it will default to 0.

HTML

html

    <p>
      He got a <meter low="69" high="80" max="100" value="84">B</meter> on the exam.
    </p>

Result

On Google Chrome, the resulting meter looks like this:

# <nav>: The Navigation Section element#

The <nav> HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is
to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to
other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus,
tables of contents, and indexes.

Try it

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

-   It's not necessary for all links to be contained in a <nav> element.
    <nav> is intended only for a major block of navigation links;
    typically the <footer> element often has a list of links that don't
    need to be in a <nav> element.
-   A document may have several <nav> elements, for example, one for
    site navigation and one for intra-page navigation. aria-labelledby
    can be used in such case to promote accessibility, see example.
-   User agents, such as screen readers targeting disabled users, can
    use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering
    of navigation-only content.

Examples

In this example, a <nav> block is used to contain an unordered list
(<ul>) of links. With appropriate CSS, this can be presented as a
sidebar, navigation bar, or drop-down menu.

html

    <nav class="menu">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>

The semantics of the nav element is that of providing links. However a
nav element doesn't have to contain a list, it can contain other kinds
of content as well. In this navigation block, links are provided in
prose:

html

    <nav>
      <h2>Navigation</h2>
      <p>
        You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, from
        whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see a large
        mountain, upon which many <a href="/school">school papers</a> are littered.
        Far up this mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me,
        desperately scribbling a <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled
        <a href="https://games.example.com/">"games"</a>. Another more
        boring-looking exit is labeled <a href="https://isp.example.net/">ISP™</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the south lies a dark and dank <a href="/about">contacts page</a>.
        Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you see a rat run
        quickly out of the page.
      </p>
    </nav>

# <nobr>: The Non-Breaking Text element#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <nobr> HTML element prevents the text it contains from automatically
wrapping across multiple lines, potentially resulting in the user having
to scroll horizontally to see the entire width of the text.

Warning: Although this element is widely supported, it was never
standard HTML, so you shouldn't use it. Instead, use the CSS property
white-space like this:

html

    <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Long line with no breaks</span>

# <noembed>: The Embed Fallback element#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <noembed> HTML element is an obsolete, non-standard way to provide
alternative, or "fallback", content for browsers that do not support the
<embed> element or do not support the type of embedded content an author
wishes to use. This element was deprecated in HTML 4.01 and above in
favor of placing fallback content between the opening and closing tags
of an <object> element.

Note: While this element currently still works in many browsers, it is
obsolete and should not be used. Use <object> instead, with fallback
content between the opening and closing tags of the element.

Examples

The message inside <noembed> tag will appear only when your browser does
not support <embed> tag.

Show an alternative content

html

    <embed type="vide/webm" src="/media/examples/flower.mp4" width="200" height="200">

# <noframes>: The Frame Fallback element#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <noframes> HTML element provides content to be presented in browsers
that don't support (or have disabled support for) the <frame> element.
Although most commonly-used browsers support frames, there are
exceptions, including certain special-use browsers including some mobile
browsers, as well as text-mode browsers.

A <noframes> element can contain any HTML elements that are allowed
within the body of an HTML document, except for the <frameset> and
<frame> elements, since using frames when they aren't supported doesn't
make sense.

<noframes> can be used to present a message explaining that the user's
browser doesn't support frames, but ideally should be used to present an
alternate form of the site that doesn't use frames but still offers the
same or similar functionality.

Note: This element is obsolete and shouldn't be used, since the <frame>
and <frameset> elements are also obsolete. When frames are needed at
all, they should be presented using the <iframe> element.

Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global
attributes. It has no other attributes available.

Example

In this example, we see a frameset with two frames. In addition,
<noframes> is used to present an explanatory message if the user agent
doesn't support frames.

html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <!-- Document metadata goes here -->
      </head>
      <frameset rows="45%, 55%">
        <frame src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/frameset" />
        <frame src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/frame" />
        <noframes>
          <p>
            It seems your browser does not support frames or is configured to not
            allow them.
          </p>
        </noframes>
      </frameset>

Attributes

This element also accepts the global attributes.

reversed

    This Boolean attribute specifies that the list's items are in
    reverse order. Items will be numbered from high to low.

start

    An integer to start counting from for the list items. Always an
    Arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, etc.), even when the numbering type is
    letters or Roman numerals. For example, to start numbering elements
    from the letter "d" or the Roman numeral "iv," use start="4".

type

    Sets the numbering type:

    -   a for lowercase letters
    -   A for uppercase letters
    -   i for lowercase Roman numerals
    -   I for uppercase Roman numerals
    -   1 for numbers (default)

    The specified type is used for the entire list unless a different
    type attribute is used on an enclosed <li> element.

    Note: Unless the type of the list number matters (like legal or
    technical documents where items are referenced by their
    number/letter), use the CSS list-style-type property instead.

Usage notes

Typically, ordered list items display with a preceding marker, such as a
number or letter.

The <ol> and <ul> elements may nest as deeply as desired, alternating
between <ol> and <ul> however you like.

The <ol> and <ul> elements both represent a list of items. The
difference is with the <ol> element, the order is meaningful. For
example:

-   Steps in a recipe
-   Turn-by-turn directions
-   The list of ingredients in decreasing proportion on nutrition
    information labels

To determine which list to use, try changing the order of the list
items; if the meaning changes, use the <ol> element — otherwise you can
use <ul>.

Examples

Simple example

Attributes

disabled

    If this Boolean attribute is set, this option is not checkable.
    Often browsers grey out such control and it won't receive any
    browsing event, like mouse clicks or focus-related ones. If this
    attribute is not set, the element can still be disabled if one of
    its ancestors is a disabled <optgroup> element.

label

    This attribute is text for the label indicating the meaning of the
    option. If the label attribute isn't defined, its value is that of
    the element text content.

selected

    If present, this Boolean attribute indicates that the option is
    initially selected. If the <option> element is the descendant of a
    <select> element whose multiple attribute is not set, only one
    single <option> of this <select> element may have the selected
    attribute.

value

    The content of this attribute represents the value to be submitted
    with the form, should this option be selected. If this attribute is
    omitted, the value is taken from the text content of the option
    element.

Styling with CSS

Styling the <option> element is highly limited. Options don't inherit
the font set on the parent. In Firefox, only color and background-color
can be set, however in Chrome and Safari it's not possible to set any
properties. You can find more details about styling in our guide to
advanced form styling.

Examples

See <select> for examples.

# <output>: The Output element#

The <output> HTML element is a container element into which a site or
app can inject the results of a calculation or the outcome of a user
action.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

for

    A space-separated list of other elements' ids, indicating that those
    elements contributed input values to (or otherwise affected) the
    calculation.

form

    The <form> element to associate the output with (its form owner).
    The value of this attribute must be the id of a <form> in the same
    document. (If this attribute is not set, the <output> is associated
    with its ancestor <form> element, if any.)

    This attribute lets you associate <output> elements to <form>s
    anywhere in the document, not just inside a <form>. It can also
    override an ancestor <form> element.

name

    The element's name. Used in the form.elements API.

The <output> value, name, and contents are NOT submitted during form
submission.

Examples

In the following example, the form provides a slider whose value can
range between 0 and 100, and an <input> element into which you can enter
a second number. The two numbers are added together, and the result is
displayed in the <output> element each time the value of any of the
controls changes.

html

    <form oninput="result.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
      <input type="range" id="b" name="b" value="50" /> +
      <input type="number" id="a" name="a" value="10" /> =
      <output name="result" for="a b">60</output>
    </form>

Result

Accessibility concerns

Many browsers implement this element as an aria-live region. Assistive
technology will thereby announce the results of UI interactions posted
inside it without requiring that focus is switched away from the
controls that produce those results.

# <p>: The Paragraph element#

The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually
represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent
blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs
can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or
form fields.

Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically
close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing </p>
tag. See "Tag omission" below.

Styling paragraphs

By default, browsers separate paragraphs with a single blank line.
Alternate separation methods, such as first-line indentation, can be
achieved with CSS:

HTML

html

    <p>
      Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest for readers to scan, but
      they can also be separated by indenting their first lines. This is often used
      to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.
    </p>

    <p>
      Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school papers and rough drafts,
      uses both blank lines and indentation for separation. In finished works,
      combining both is considered redundant and amateurish.
    </p>

    <p>
      In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a special character: ¶,
      the <i>pilcrow</i>. Nowadays, this is considered claustrophobic and hard to
      read.
    </p>

    <p>
      How hard to read? See for yourself:
      <button data-toggle-text="Oh no! Switch back!">
        Use pilcrow for paragraphs
      </button>

      [event.target.innerText, event.target.dataset.toggleText] = [
        event.target.dataset.toggleText,
        event.target.innerText,
      ];
    });

Accessibility concerns

Breaking up content into paragraphs helps make a page more accessible.
Screen-readers and other assistive technology provide shortcuts to let
their users skip to the next or previous paragraph, letting them skim
content like how white space lets visual users skip around.

Using empty <p> elements to add space between paragraphs is problematic
for people who navigate with screen-reading technology. Screen readers
may announce the paragraph's presence, but not any content contained
within it — because there is none. This can confuse and frustrate the
person using the screen reader.

If extra space is desired, use CSS properties like margin to create the
effect:

css

    p {
      margin-bottom: 2em; /* increase white space after a paragraph */
    }

# <picture>: The Picture element#

The <picture> HTML element contains zero or more <source> elements and
one <img> element to offer alternative versions of an image for
different display/device scenarios.

The browser will consider each child <source> element and choose the
best match among them. If no matches are found—or the browser doesn't
support the <picture> element—the URL of the <img> element's src
attribute is selected. The selected image is then presented in the space
occupied by the <img> element.

%html-content%

To decide which URL to load, the user agent examines each <source>'s
srcset, media, and type attributes to select a compatible image that
best matches the current layout and capabilities of the display device.

The <img> element serves two purposes:

1.  It describes the size and other attributes of the image and its
    presentation.
2.  It provides a fallback in case none of the offered <source> elements
    are able to provide a usable image.

Common use cases for <picture>:

-   Art direction. Cropping or modifying images for different media
    conditions (for example, loading a simpler version of an image which
    has too many details, on smaller displays).
-   Offering alternative image formats, for cases where certain formats
    are not supported.
    Note: For example, newer formats like AVIF or WEBP have many
    advantages, but might not be supported by the browser. A list of
    supported image formats can be found in: Image file type and format
    guide.
-   Saving bandwidth and speeding page load times by loading the most
    appropriate image for the viewer's display.

If providing higher-density versions of an image for high-DPI (Retina)
display, use srcset on the <img> element instead. This lets browsers opt
for lower-density versions in data-saving modes, and you don't have to
write explicit media conditions.

Attributes

This element includes only global attributes.

Usage notes

You can use the object-position property to adjust the positioning of
the image within the element's frame, and the object-fit property to
control how the image is resized to fit within the frame.

Note: Use these properties on the child <img> element, not the <picture>
element.

Examples

These examples demonstrate how different attributes of the <source>
element change the selection of the image inside <picture>.

The media attribute

The media attribute specifies a media condition (similar to a media
query) that the user agent will evaluate for each <source> element.

If the <source>'s media condition evaluates to false, the browser skips
it and evaluates the next element inside <picture>.

html

    <picture>
      <source srcset="mdn-logo-wide.png" media="(min-width: 600px)" />
      <img src="mdn-logo-narrow.png" alt="MDN" />
    </picture>

The srcset attribute

The srcset attribute is used to offer a list of possible images based on
size or the display's pixel density.

It is composed of a comma-separated list of image descriptors. Each
image descriptor is composed of a URL of the image, and either:

-   a width descriptor, followed by a w (such as 300w); OR
-   a pixel density descriptor, followed by an x (such as 2x) to serve a
    high-res image for high-DPI screens.

Make sure to note that:

-   width and pixel density descriptors should not be used together
-   a missing pixel density descriptor implies 1x
-   duplicate descriptor values are not allowed (2x & 2x, 100w & 100w)

The following example illustrates the usage of srcset attribute with the
<source> element to specify a high-density and standard-resolution
image:

html

    <picture>
      <source srcset="logo.png, logo-1.5x.png 1.5x" />
      <img src="logo.png" alt="MDN Web Docs logo" height="320" width="320" />
    </picture>

The srcset attribute can also be used on the <img> element without
needing the <picture> element. The following example demonstrates how to
use the srcset attribute to specify standard-resolution and high-density
images, respectively:

html

    <img
      srcset="logo.png, logo-2x.png 2x"
      src="logo.png"
      height="320"
      width="320"
      alt="MDN Web Docs logo" />

The sizes attribute is not mandatory when using srcset, but it is
recommended to use it in order to provide additional information to the
browser to help it select the best image source.

Without sizes, the browser will use the default size of the image as
specified by its dimensions in pixels. This may not be the best fit for
all devices, especially if the image is displayed on different screen
sizes or in different contexts.

Please note that sizes will have its effect only if width dimension
descriptors are provided with srcset instead of pixel ratio values (200w
instead of 2x for example). For more information on using srcset, see
the Responsive images documentation.

The type attribute

The type attribute specifies a MIME type for the resource URL(s) in the
<source> element's srcset attribute. If the user agent does not support
the given type, the <source> element is skipped.

html

    <picture>
      <source srcset="photo.avif" type="image/avif" />
      <source srcset="photo.webp" type="image/webp" />
      <img src="photo.jpg" alt="photo" />

# <plaintext>: The Plain Text element (Deprecated)#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <plaintext> HTML element renders everything following the start tag
as raw text, ignoring any following HTML. There is no closing tag, since
everything after it is considered raw text.

Warning: Do not use this element.

-   <plaintext> is deprecated since HTML 2, and not all browsers
    implemented it. Browsers that did implement it didn't do so
    consistently.
-   <plaintext> is obsolete; browsers that accept it may instead treat
    it as a <pre> element that still interprets HTML within.
-   If <plaintext> is the first element on the page (other than any
    non-displayed elements, like <head>), do not use HTML at all.
    Instead serve a text file with the text/plain MIME-type.
-   Instead of <plaintext>, use the <pre> element or, if semantically
    accurate (such as for inline text), the <code> element. Escape any
    <, > and & characters, to prevent browsers inadvertently parsing
    content the element content as HTML.
-   A monospaced font can be applied to any HTML element via a CSS
    font-family style with the monospace generic value.

Attributes

This element has no other attributes than the global attributes common
to all elements.

DOM interface

This element implements the HTMLElement interface.

# <portal>: The Portal element#

Experimental: This is an experimental technology
Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this in
production.

The <portal> HTML element enables the embedding of another HTML page
into the current one for the purposes of allowing smoother navigation
into new pages.

A <portal> is similar to an <iframe>. An <iframe> allows a separate
browsing context to be embedded. However, the embedded content of a
<portal> is more limited than that of an <iframe>. It cannot be
interacted with, and therefore is not suitable for embedding widgets
into a document. Instead, the <portal> acts as a preview of the content
of another page. It can be navigated into therefore allowing for
seamless transition to the embedded content.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

referrerpolicy

    Sets the referrer policy to use when requesting the page at the URL
    given as the value of the src attribute.

src

    The URL of the page to embed.

Examples

Basic example

The following example will embed the contents of https://example.com as
a preview.

html

    <portal id="exampleportal" src="https://example.com/"></portal>

Accessibility concerns

The preview displayed by a <portal> is not interactive, therefore does
not receive input events or focus. Therefore the embedded contents of
the portal are not exposed as elements in the accessibility tree. The
portal can be navigated to and activated like a button, the default
behavior when clicking on the portal is to activate it.

Portals are given a default label which is the title of the embedded
page. If no title is present the visible text in the preview is
concatenated to create a label. The aria-label attribute can be used to
override this.

Portals used for prerendering only should be hidden with the hidden HTML
attribute or the CSS display property with a value of none.

When using animations during portal activation the
prefers-reduced-motion media feature should be respected.

# <pre>: The Preformatted Text element#

The <pre> HTML element represents preformatted text which is to be
presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically
rendered using a non-proportional, or monospaced, font. Whitespace
inside this element is displayed as written.

By default, <pre> is a block-level element, i.e. its default display
value is block.

Attributes

cols Non-standard Deprecated

    Contains the preferred count of characters that a line should have.
    It was a non-standard synonym of width. To achieve such an effect,
    use CSS width instead.

width Deprecated Non-standard

    Contains the preferred count of characters that a line should have.
    Though technically still implemented, this attribute has no visual
    effect; to achieve such an effect, use CSS width instead.

wrap Non-standard Deprecated

    Is a hint indicating how the overflow must happen. In modern browser
    this hint is ignored and no visual effect results in its present; to
    achieve such an effect, use CSS white-space instead.

Accessibility concerns

It is important to provide an alternate description for any images or
diagrams created using preformatted text. The alternate description
should clearly and concisely describe the image or diagram's content.

People experiencing low vision conditions and browsing with the aid of
assistive technology such as a screen reader may not understand what the
preformatted text characters are representing when they are read out in
sequence.

A combination of the <figure> and <figcaption> elements, supplemented by
the ARIA role and aria-label attributes on the pre element allow the
preformatted ASCII art to be announced as an image with alternative
text, and the figcaption serving as the image's caption.

Example

html

    <figure>
      <pre role="img" aria-label="ASCII COW">
          ___________________________
      &lt; I'm an expert in my field. &gt;

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

max

    This attribute describes how much work the task indicated by the
    progress element requires. The max attribute, if present, must have
    a value greater than 0 and be a valid floating point number. The
    default value is 1.

value

    This attribute specifies how much of the task that has been
    completed. It must be a valid floating point number between 0 and
    max, or between 0 and 1 if max is omitted. If there is no value
    attribute, the progress bar is indeterminate; this indicates that an
    activity is ongoing with no indication of how long it is expected to
    take.

Note: Unlike the <meter> element, the minimum value is always 0, and the
min attribute is not allowed for the <progress> element.

Note: The :indeterminate pseudo-class can be used to match against
indeterminate progress bars. To change the progress bar to indeterminate
after giving it a value you must remove the value attribute with
element.removeAttribute('value').

Examples

html

    <progress value="70" max="100">70 %</progress>

Result

Accessibility concerns

Labelling

In most cases you should provide an accessible label when using
<progress>. While you can use the standard ARIA labelling attributes
aria-labelledby or aria-label as you would for any element with
role="progressbar", when using <progress> you can alternatively use the
<label> element.

Note: Text placed between the element's tags is not an accessible label,
it is only recommended as a fallback for old browsers that do not
support this element.

Examples

html

    <label>
      Uploading Document: <progress value="70" max="100">70 %</progress>
    </label>

    <!-- OR -->
    <br />

    <label for="progress-bar">Uploading Document</label>
    <progress id="progress-bar" value="70" max="100">70 %</progress>

Result

Describing a particular region

If the <progress> element is describing the loading progress of a
section of a page, use aria-describedby to point to the status, and set
aria-busy="true" on the section that is being updated, removing the
aria-busy attribute when it has finished loading.

Examples

html

    <div aria-busy="true" aria-describedby="progress-bar">
      <!-- content is for this region is loading -->
    </div>

    <!-- ... -->

    <progress id="progress-bar" aria-label="Content loading…"></progress>

# <rb>: The Ruby Base element#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <rb> HTML element is used to delimit the base text component of a
<ruby> annotation, i.e. the text that is being annotated. One <rb>
element should wrap each separate atomic segment of the base text.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

-   Ruby annotations are for showing pronunciation of East Asian
    characters, like using Japanese furigana or Taiwanese bopomofo
    characters. The <rb> element is used to separate out each segment of
    the ruby base text.
-   Even though <rb> is not a void element, it is common to just include
    the opening tag of each element in the source code, so that the ruby
    markup is less complex and easier to read. The browser can then fill
    in the full element in the rendered version.
-   You need to include one <rt> element for each base segment/<rb>
    element that you want to annotate.

Examples

Using rb

In this example, we provide an annotation for the original character
equivalent of "Kanji":

html

    <ruby>
      <rb>漢</rb><rb>字 </rb><rp>(</rp><rt>kan</rt><rt>ji</rt><rp>)</rp>
    </ruby>

Note how we've included two <rb> elements, to delimit the two separate
parts of the ruby base text. The annotation on the other hand is
delimited by two <rt> elements.

Result

Separate annotations

Note that we could also write this example with the two base text parts
annotated completely separately. In this case we don't need to include
<rb> elements:

html

    <ruby>
      漢 <rp>(</rp><rt>Kan</rt><rp>)</rp> 字 <rp>(</rp><rt>ji</rt><rp>)</rp>
    </ruby>

# <rp>: The Ruby Fallback Parenthesis element#

The <rp> HTML element is used to provide fall-back parentheses for

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

-   Ruby annotations are for showing pronunciation of East Asian
    characters, like using Japanese furigana or Taiwanese bopomofo
    characters. The <rp> element is used in the case of lack of <ruby>
    element support; the <rp> content provides what should be displayed
    in order to indicate the presence of a ruby annotation, usually
    parentheses.

Examples

Using ruby annotations

This example uses ruby annotations to display the Romaji equivalents for
each character.

html

    <ruby>
      漢 <rp>(</rp><rt>Kan</rt><rp>)</rp> 字 <rp>(</rp><rt>ji</rt><rp>)</rp>
    </ruby>

    body {
      font-size: 22px;
    }

Result

See the article about the <ruby> element for further examples.

Without ruby support

If your browser does not support ruby annotations, the result looks like
this instead:

# <rt>: The Ruby Text element#

The <rt> HTML element specifies the ruby text component of a ruby
annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or
transliteration information for East Asian typography. The <rt> element
must always be contained within a <ruby> element.

# <ruby>: The Ruby Annotation element#

The <ruby> HTML element represents small annotations that are rendered
above, below, or next to base text, usually used for showing the
pronunciation of East Asian characters. It can also be used for
annotating other kinds of text, but this usage is less common.

The term ruby originated as a unit of measurement used by typesetters,
representing the smallest size that text can be printed on newsprint
while remaining legible.

# <samp>: The Sample Output element#

The <samp> HTML element is used to enclose inline text which represents
sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are
typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as
Courier or Lucida Console).

Try it

    samp {
      font-weight: bold;
    }

Output

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

You can use a CSS rule to override the browser's default font face for
the <samp> element; however, it's possible that the browser's
preferences may take precedence over any CSS you specify.

The CSS to override the default font face would look like this:

css

    samp {
      font-family: "Courier";
    }

Note: If you need an element which will serve as a container for output
generated by your website or app's JavaScript code, you should instead
use the <output> element.

Examples

Basic example

In this simple example, a paragraph includes an example of the output of
a program.

html

    <p>
      When the process is complete, the utility will output the text
      <samp>Scan complete. Found <em>N</em> results.</samp> You can then proceed to
      the next step.
    </p>

Result

Sample output including user input

You can nest the <kbd> element within a <samp> block to present an
example that includes text entered by the user. For example, consider
this text presenting a transcript of a Linux (or macOS) console session:

HTML

html

    <pre>
    <samp><span class="prompt">mike@interwebz:~$</span> <kbd>md5 -s "Hello world"</kbd>
    MD5 ("Hello world") = 3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62

    <span class="prompt">mike@interwebz:~$</span> <span class="cursor">█</span></samp></pre>

Note the use of <span> to allow customization of the appearance of
specific portions of the sample text such as the shell prompts and the
cursor. Note also the use of <kbd> to represent the command the user
entered at the prompt in the sample text.

CSS

The CSS that achieves the appearance we want is:

css

    .prompt {
      color: #b00;
    }

    samp > kbd {
      font-weight: bold;
    }

    .cursor {
      color: #00b;
    }

This gives the prompt and cursor fairly subtle colorization and
emboldens the keyboard input within the sample text.

Result

The resulting output is this:

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

async

    For classic scripts, if the async attribute is present, then the
    classic script will be fetched in parallel to parsing and evaluated
    as soon as it is available.

    For module scripts, if the async attribute is present then the
    scripts and all their dependencies will be fetched in parallel to
    parsing and evaluated as soon as they are available.

    This attribute allows the elimination of parser-blocking JavaScript
    where the browser would have to load and evaluate scripts before
    continuing to parse. defer has a similar effect in this case.

    This is a boolean attribute: the presence of a boolean attribute on
    an element represents the true value, and the absence of the
    attribute represents the false value.

    See Browser compatibility for notes on browser support. See also
    Async scripts for asm.js.

blocking Experimental

    This attribute explicitly indicates that certain operations should
    be blocked on the fetching of the script. The operations that are to
    be blocked must be a space-separated list of blocking attributes
    listed below.

    -   render: The rendering of content on the screen is blocked.

crossorigin

    Normal script elements pass minimal information to the
    window.onerror for scripts which do not pass the standard CORS
    checks. To allow error logging for sites which use a separate domain
    for static media, use this attribute. See CORS settings attributes
    for a more descriptive explanation of its valid arguments.

defer

    This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the
    script is meant to be executed after the document has been parsed,
    but before firing DOMContentLoaded.

    Scripts with the defer attribute will prevent the DOMContentLoaded
    event from firing until the script has loaded and finished
    evaluating.

    Warning: This attribute must not be used if the src attribute is
    absent (i.e. for inline scripts), in this case it would have no
    effect.

    The defer attribute has no effect on module scripts — they defer by
    default.

    Scripts with the defer attribute will execute in the order in which
    they appear in the document.

    This attribute allows the elimination of parser-blocking JavaScript
    where the browser would have to load and evaluate scripts before
    continuing to parse. async has a similar effect in this case.

fetchpriority

    Provides a hint of the relative priority to use when fetching an
    external script. Allowed values:

    high

        Signals a high-priority fetch relative to other external
        scripts.

    low

        Signals a low-priority fetch relative to other external scripts.

    auto

        Default: Signals automatic determination of fetch priority
        relative to other external scripts.

integrity

    This attribute contains inline metadata that a user agent can use to
    verify that a fetched resource has been delivered free of unexpected
    manipulation. See Subresource Integrity.

nomodule

    This Boolean attribute is set to indicate that the script should not
    be executed in browsers that support ES modules — in effect, this
    can be used to serve fallback scripts to older browsers that do not
    support modular JavaScript code.

nonce

    A cryptographic nonce (number used once) to allow scripts in a
    script-src Content-Security-Policy. The server must generate a
    unique nonce value each time it transmits a policy. It is critical
    to provide a nonce that cannot be guessed as bypassing a resource's
    policy is otherwise trivial.

referrerpolicy

    Indicates which referrer to send when fetching the script, or
    resources fetched by the script:

    -   no-referrer: The Referer header will not be sent.
    -   no-referrer-when-downgrade: The Referer header will not be sent
        to origins without TLS (HTTPS).
    -   origin: The sent referrer will be limited to the origin of the
        referring page: its scheme, host, and port.
    -   origin-when-cross-origin: The referrer sent to other origins
        will be limited to the scheme, the host, and the port.
        Navigations on the same origin will still include the path.
    -   same-origin: A referrer will be sent for same origin, but
        cross-origin requests will contain no referrer information.
    -   strict-origin: Only send the origin of the document as the
        referrer when the protocol security level stays the same
        (HTTPS→HTTPS), but don't send it to a less secure destination
        (HTTPS→HTTP).
    -   strict-origin-when-cross-origin (default): Send a full URL when
        performing a same-origin request, only send the origin when the
        protocol security level stays the same (HTTPS→HTTPS), and send
        no header to a less secure destination (HTTPS→HTTP).
    -   unsafe-url: The referrer will include the origin and the path
        (but not the fragment, password, or username). This value is
        unsafe, because it leaks origins and paths from TLS-protected
        resources to insecure origins.

    Note: An empty string value ("") is both the default value, and a
    fallback value if referrerpolicy is not supported. If referrerpolicy
    is not explicitly specified on the <script> element, it will adopt a
    higher-level referrer policy, i.e. one set on the whole document or
    domain. If a higher-level policy is not available, the empty string
    is treated as being equivalent to strict-origin-when-cross-origin.

src

    This attribute specifies the URI of an external script; this can be
    used as an alternative to embedding a script directly within a
    document.

type

    This attribute indicates the type of script represented. The value
    of this attribute will be one of the following:

    Attribute is not set (default), an empty string, or a JavaScript MIME type

        Indicates that the script is a "classic script", containing
        JavaScript code. Authors are encouraged to omit the attribute if
        the script refers to JavaScript code rather than specify a MIME
        type. JavaScript MIME types are listed in the IANA media types
        specification.

    importmap

        This value indicates that the body of the element contains an
        import map. The import map is a JSON object that developers can
        use to control how the browser resolves module specifiers when
        importing JavaScript modules.

    module

        This value causes the code to be treated as a JavaScript module.
        The processing of the script contents is deferred. The charset
        and defer attributes have no effect. For information on using
        module, see our JavaScript modules guide. Unlike classic
        scripts, module scripts require the use of the CORS protocol for
        cross-origin fetching.

    speculationrules Experimental

        This value indicates that the body of the element contains
        speculation rules. Speculation rules take the form of a JSON
        object that determine what resources should be prefetched or
        prerendered by the browser. This is part of the Speculation
        Rules API.

    Any other value

        The embedded content is treated as a data block, and won't be
        processed by the browser. Developers must use a valid MIME type
        that is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks. All of
        the other attributes will be ignored, including the src
        attribute.

Deprecated attributes

charset Deprecated

    If present, its value must be an ASCII case-insensitive match for
    "utf-8". It's unnecessary to specify the charset attribute, because
    documents must use UTF-8, and the script element inherits its
    character encoding from the document.

language Deprecated Non-standard

    Like the type attribute, this attribute identifies the scripting
    language in use. Unlike the type attribute, however, this
    attribute's possible values were never standardized. The type
    attribute should be used instead.

Notes

Scripts without async, defer or type="module" attributes, as well as
inline scripts without the type="module" attribute, are fetched and
executed immediately before the browser continues to parse the page.

The script should be served with the text/javascript MIME type, but
browsers are lenient and only block them if the script is served with an
image type (image/*), a video type (video/*), an audio type (audio/*),
or text/csv. If the script is blocked, an error event is sent to the
element; otherwise, a load event is sent.

Examples

Basic usage

These examples show how to import (an external) script using the
<script> element.

html

    <script src="javascript.js"></script>

And the following examples show how to put (an inline) script inside the
<script> element.

html

    <script>
      alert("Hello World!");
    </script>

Module fallback

Browsers that support the module value for the type attribute ignore any
script with a nomodule attribute. That enables you to use module scripts
while providing nomodule-marked fallback scripts for non-supporting
browsers.

html

    <script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
    <script nomodule src="fallback.js"></script>

Importing modules with importmap

When importing modules in scripts, if you don't use the type=importmap
feature, then each module must be imported using a module specifier that
is either an absolute or relative URL. In the example below, the first
module specifier ("./shapes/square.js") resolves relative to the base
URL of the document, while the second is an absolute URL.

js

    import { name as squareName, draw } from "./shapes/square.js";
    import { name as circleName } from "https://example.com/shapes/circle.js";

An import map allows you to provide a mapping that, if matched, can
replace the text in the module specifier. The import map below defines
keys square and circle that can be used as aliases for the module
specifiers shown above.

html

    <script type="importmap">
      {
        "imports": {
          "square": "./shapes/square.js",
          "circle": "https://example.com/shapes/circle.js"
        }
      }
    </script>

This allows us to import modules using names in the module specifier
(rather than absolute or relative URLs).

js

    import { name as squareName, draw } from "square";
    import { name as circleName } from "circle";

For more examples of what you can do with import maps, see the Importing
modules using import maps section in the JavaScript modules guide.

Embedding data in HTML

You can also use the <script> element to embed data in HTML with
server-side rendering by specifying a valid non-JavaScript MIME type in
the type attribute.

html

    <!-- Generated by the server -->
    <script id="data" type="application/json">
      {
        "userId": 1234,
        "userName": "Maria Cruz",
        "memberSince": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
      }
    </script>

    <!-- Static -->
    <script>
      const userInfo = JSON.parse(document.getElementById("data").text);
      console.log("User information: %o", userInfo);
    </script>

Blocking rendering till a script is fetched and executed

You can include render token inside a blocking attribute; the rendering
of the page will be blocked till the script is fetched and executed. In
the example below, we block rendering on an async script, so that the
script doesn't block parsing but is guaranteed to be evaluated before
rendering starts.

html

    <script blocking="render" async src="async-script.js"></script>

# <script>: type attribute#

The type attribute of the <script> element indicates the type of script
represented by the element: a classic script, an import map, a
JavaScript module, speculation rules, or a data block.

Value

The value of this attribute indicates the type of data represented by
the script, and will be one of the following:

Attribute is not set (default), an empty string, or a JavaScript MIME type

    Indicates that the script is a "classic script", containing
    JavaScript code. Authors are encouraged to omit the attribute if the
    script refers to JavaScript code rather than specify a MIME type.
    JavaScript MIME types are listed in the IANA media types
    specification.

importmap

    This value indicates that the body of the element contains an import
    map. The import map is a JSON object that developers can use to
    control how the browser resolves module specifiers when importing
    JavaScript modules.

module

    This value causes the code to be treated as a JavaScript module. The
    processing of the script contents is deferred. The charset and defer
    attributes have no effect. For information on using module, see our
    JavaScript modules guide. Unlike classic scripts, module scripts
    require the use of the CORS protocol for cross-origin fetching.

speculationrules Experimental

    speculation rules. Speculation rules take the form of a JSON object
    that determine what resources should be prefetched or prerendered by
    the browser. This is part of the Speculation Rules API.

Any other value

    The embedded content is treated as a data block, and won't be
    processed by the browser. Developers must use a valid MIME type that
    is not a JavaScript MIME type to denote data blocks. All of the
    other attributes will be ignored, including the src attribute.

Note: In earlier browsers, the type identified the scripting language of
the embedded or imported (via the src attribute) code.

The importmap value of the type attribute of the <script> element
indicates that the body of the element contains an import map.

An import map is a JSON object that allows developers to control how the
browser resolves module specifiers when importing JavaScript modules. It
provides a mapping between the text used as the module specifier in an
import statement or import() operator, and the corresponding value that
will replace the text when resolving the specifier. The JSON object must
conform to the Import map JSON representation format.

An import map is used to resolve module specifiers in static and dynamic
imports, and therefore must be declared and processed before any
<script> elements that import modules using specifiers declared in the
map. Note that the import map applies only to module specifiers in the
import statement or import() operator for modules loaded into documents;
it does not apply to the path specified in the src attribute of a
<script> element or to modules loaded into workers or worklets.

For more information, see the Importing modules using import maps
section in the JavaScript modules guide.

referrerpolicy attributes must not be specified.

Only the first import map in the document with an inline definition is
processed; any additional import maps and external import maps are
ignored.

Exceptions

TypeError

    The import map definition is not a JSON object, the importmap key is
    defined but its value is not a JSON object, or the scopes key is
    defined but its value is not a JSON object.

Browsers generate console warnings for other cases where the import map
JSON does not conform to the import map schema.

An error event is fired at script elements with type="importmap" that
are not processed. This might occur, for example, if module loading has
already started when an import map is processed, or if multiple import
maps are defined in the page.

Description

When importing a JavaScript module, both the import statement and
import() operator have a "module specifier" that indicates the module to
be imported. A browser must be able to resolve this specifier to an
absolute URL in order to import the module.

For example, the following statements import elements from the module
specifier "./modules/shapes/square.js", which is a path relative to the
base URL of the document, and the module specifier
"https://example.com/shapes/circle.js", which is an absolute URL.

js

    import { name as squareName, draw } from "./modules/shapes/square.js";
    import { name as circleName } from "https://example.com/shapes/circle.js";

Import maps allow developers to specify (almost) any text they want in
the module specifier; the map provides a corresponding value that will
replace the text when the module specifier is resolved.

Bare modules

The import map below defines an imports key that has a "module specifier
map" with properties square and circle.

html

    <script type="importmap">
      {
        "imports": {
          "square": "./module/shapes/square.js",
          "circle": "https://example.com/shapes/circle.js"
        }
      }
    </script>

With this import map we can import the same modules as above, but using
"bare modules" in our module specifiers:

js

    import { name as squareName, draw } from "square";
    import { name as circleName } from "circle";

Mapping path prefixes

A module specifier map key can also be used to remap a path prefix in a
module specifier. Note that in this case the property and mapped path
must both have a trailing forward slash (/).

html

    <script type="importmap">
      {
        "imports": {
          "shapes/": "./module/shapes/",
          "othershapes/": "https://example.com/modules/shapes/"
        }
      }
    </script>

We could then import a circle module as shown.

js

    import { name as circleName } from "shapes/circle.js";

Paths in the module specifier map key

Module specifier keys do not have to be single word names ("bare
names"). They can also contain or end with path separators, or be
absolute URLs, or be relative URL paths that start with /, ./, or ../.

json

    {
      "imports": {
        "modules/shapes/": "./module/src/shapes/",
        "modules/square": "./module/src/other/shapes/square.js",
        "https://example.com/modules/square.js": "./module/src/other/shapes/square.js",
        "../modules/shapes/": "/modules/shapes/"
      }
    }

If there are several module specifier keys in a module specifier map
that might match, then the most specific key will be selected (i.e. the
one with the longer path/value).

A module specifier of ./foo/../js/app.js would be resolved to
./js/app.js before matching. This means that a module specifier key of
./js/app.js would match the module specifier even though they are not
exactly the same.

Scoped module specifier maps

You can use the scopes key to provide mappings that are only used if the
script importing the module contains a particular URL path. If the URL
of the loading script matches the supplied path, the mapping associated
with the scope will be used. This allows different versions of the
module to be used depending on what code is doing the importing.

For example, the map below will only use the scoped map if the loading
module has a URL that includes the path: "/modules/customshapes/".

html

    <script type="importmap">
      {
        "imports": {
          "square": "./module/shapes/square.js"
        },
        "scopes": {
          "/modules/customshapes/": {
            "square": "https://example.com/modules/shapes/square.js"
          }
        }
      }
    </script>

If multiple scopes match the referrer URL, then the most specific scope
path is used (the scope key name with the longest name). The browser
falls back to the next most specific scoped path if there is no matching
specifier, and so on, eventually falling back to the module specifier
map in the imports key.

Import map JSON representation

The following is a "formal" definition of the import map JSON
representation.

The import map must be a valid JSON object that can define at most two
optional keys: imports and scopes. Each key's value must be an object,
which may be empty.

imports Optional

    The value is a module specifier map, which provides the mappings
    between module specifier text that might appear in an import
    statement or import() operator, and the text that will replace it
    when the specifier is resolved.

    This is the fallback map that is searched for matching module
    specifiers if no scopes path URLs match, or if module specifier maps
    in matching scopes paths do not contain a key that matches the
    module specifier.

    <module specifier map>

        A "module specifier map" is a valid JSON object where the keys
        are text that may be present in the module specifier when
        importing a module, and the corresponding values are the URLs or
        paths that will replace this text when the module specifier is
        resolved to an address.

        The module specifier map JSON object has the following
        requirements:

        -   None of the keys may be empty.
        -   All of the values must be strings, defining either a valid
            absolute URL or a valid URL string that starts with /, ./,
            or ../.
        -   If a key ends with /, then the corresponding value must also
            end with /. A key with a trailing / can be used as a prefix
            for when mapping (or remapping) modules addresses.
        -   The object properties' ordering is irrelevant: if multiple
            keys can match the module specifier, the most specific key
            is used (in other words, a specifier "olive/branch/" would
            match before "olive/").

scopes Optional

    Scopes define path-specific module specifier maps, allowing the
    choice of map to depend on the path of the code importing the
    module.

    The scopes object is a valid JSON object where each property is a
    <scope key>, which is an URL path, with a corresponding value that
    is a <module specifier map>.

    If the URL of a script importing a module matches a <scope key>
    path, then the <module specifier map> value associated with the key
    is checked for matching specifiers first. If there are multiple
    matching scope keys, then the value associated with the most
    specific/nested scope paths are checked for matching module
    specifiers first. The fallback module specifier map in imports is
    used if there are no matching module specifier keys in any of the
    matching scoped module specifier maps.

    Note that the scope does not change how an address is resolved;
    relative addresses are always resolved to the import map base URL.

# <script type="speculationrules">#

Experimental: This is an experimental technology
Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this in
production.

The speculationrules value of the type attribute of the <script> element
indicates that the body of the element contains speculation rules.

Speculation rules take the form of a JSON structure that determine what
resources should be prefetched or prerendered by the browser. This is
part of the Speculation Rules API.

Syntax

html

    <script type="speculationrules">
      // JSON object defining rules
    </script>

Note: The src, async, nomodule, defer, crossorigin, integrity, and
referrerpolicy attributes must not be specified.

Exceptions

TypeError

    The speculation rules definition is not a valid JSON object.

Description

A <script type="speculationrules"> element must contain a valid JSON
structure that defines speculation rules. The following examples show
separate prefetch and prerender rules:

html

    <script type="speculationrules">
      {
        "prefetch": [
          {
            "source": "list",
            "urls": ["next.html", "next2.html"],
            "requires": ["anonymous-client-ip-when-cross-origin"],
            "referrer_policy": "no-referrer"
          }
        ]
      }
    </script>

html

    <script type="speculationrules">
      {
        "prerender": [
          {
            "source": "list",
            "urls": ["next3.html", "next4.html"]
          }
        ]
      }
    </script>

Speculation rules JSON representation

The JSON structure contains one or more fields at the top level, each
one representing an action to define speculation rules for. At present
the supported actions are:

"prefetch" Optional Experimental

    Rules for potential future navigations that should have their
    associated document response body downloaded, leading to significant
    performance improvements when those documents are navigated to. Note
    that none of the subresources referenced by the page are downloaded.

"prerender" Optional Experimental

    Rules for potential future navigations that should have their
    associated documents fully downloaded, rendered, and loaded into an
    invisible tab. This includes loading all subresources, running all
    JavaScript, and even loading subresources and performing data
    fetches started by JavaScript. When those documents are navigated
    to, navigations will be instant, leading to major performance
    improvements.

Note: Consult the Speculation Rules API main page for full details on
how to use prefetch and prerender effectively.

Each action field contains an array, which in turn contains one or more
objects. Each object contains a single rule defining a set of URLs and
related parameters.

Specifically, each object can contain the following properties:

"source"

    A string representing the source of the URLs to which the rule
    applies. Possible values are:

    "list"

        Denotes that the URLs will come from a specific list.

"urls"

    An array of strings representing the list of URLs to apply the rule
    to. These can be absolute or relative URLs. Relative URLs will be
    parsed relative to the document base URL (if inline in a document)
    or relative to the external resource URL (if externally fetched).

"requires" Optional Experimental

    An array of strings representing capabilities of the browser parsing
    the rule, which must be available if the rule is to be applied to
    the specified URLs.

    Warning: Prefetches will automatically fail in browsers that cannot
    meet a specified requirement, even if they support the Speculation
    Rules API.

    Possible values are:

    "anonymous-client-ip-when-cross-origin"

        "prefetch"-only. Specifies that the rule matches only if the
        user agent can prevent the client IP address from being visible
        to the origin server if a cross-origin prefetch request is
        issued. Exactly how this works is dependent on browser
        implementation specifics. For example:

        -   Chrome's implementation hides the IP address using a
            Google-owned proxy, therefore by default it only works for
            Google-controlled referrers (since in that case, sending the
            URLs of the destination to Google is not an additional
            privacy leak). When used on a non-Google-owned site, rules
            that include this will only match for users that turn on
            "Enhanced preloading" in chrome://settings/preloading.
        -   Other Chromium-based browsers will have to provide their own
            solutions. Thorough testing in all target browsers is
            advised.
        -   A future Safari implementation may possibly use something
            along the lines of iCloud Private Relay.
        -   A future Firefox implementation might use something based on
            the Mozilla VPN product.

"referrer_policy" Optional Experimental

    A string representing a specific referrer policy string to use when
    requesting the URLs specified in the rule — see Referrer-Policy for
    possible values. The purpose of this is to allow the referring page
    to set a stricter policy specifically for the speculative request
    than the policy the page already has set (either by default, or by
    using Referrer-Policy). A laxer policy set in the speculation rules
    will not override a stricter policy set on the referring page.

Note: As speculation rules use a <script> element, they need to be
explicitly allowed in the Content-Security-Policy script-src directive
if the site includes it. This is done by adding the
"inline-speculation-rules" value along with a hash- or nonce-source.

Further examples

The earlier examples showed separate speculation rules defined for
prefetch and prerender. It is possible to define both in a single set of
rules:

html

    <script type="speculationrules">
      {
        "prefetch": [
          {
            "source": "list",
            "urls": ["next.html", "next2.html"],
            "requires": ["anonymous-client-ip-when-cross-origin"],
            "referrer_policy": "no-referrer"
          }
        ],
        "prerender": [
          {
            "source": "list",
            "urls": ["next3.html", "next4.html"]
          }
        ]
      }
    </script>

It is also allowable to include multiple sets of rules in a single HTML
file:

html

    <script type="speculationrules">
      {
        "prefetch": [
          {
            "source": "list",
            "urls": ["next.html", "next2.html"],
            "requires": ["anonymous-client-ip-when-cross-origin"],
            "referrer_policy": "no-referrer"
          }
        ]
      }
    </script>
    <script type="speculationrules">
      {
        "prerender": [
          {
            "source": "list",
            "urls": ["next3.html", "next4.html"]
          }
        ]
      }
    </script>

And multiple rules in a single result set:

js

    <script type="speculationrules">
    {
      "prerender": [
        {
          "source": "list",
          "urls": ["one.html"]
        },
        {
          "source": "list",
          "urls": ["two.html"]
        }
      ]
    }
    </script>

Dynamic rule insertion

Below is an example that feature detects speculation rules and, if
supported, dynamically adds a prerender speculation rule via JavaScript:

js

    if (
      HTMLScriptElement.supports &&
      HTMLScriptElement.supports("speculationrules")
    ) {
      const specScript = document.createElement("script");
      specScript.type = "speculationrules";
      const specRules = {
        prerender: [
          {
            source: "list",
            urls: ["/next.html"],
          },
        ],
      };
      specScript.textContent = JSON.stringify(specRules);
      console.log("added speculation rules to: next.html");
      document.body.append(specScript);
    }

You can see this in action in this prerender demos page.

# <search>: The generic search element#

The <search> HTML element is a container representing the parts of the
document or application with form controls or other content related to
performing a search or filtering operation. The <search> element
semantically identifies the purpose of the element's contents as having
search or filtering capabilities. The search or filtering functionality
can be for the website or application, the current web page or document,
or the entire Internet or subsection thereof.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

The <search> element is not for presenting search results. Rather,
search or filtered results should be presented as part of the main
content of that web page. That said, suggestions and links that are part
of "quick search" functionality within the search or filtering
functionality are appropriately nested within the contents of the
<search> element as they are search features.

Accessibility concerns

The <search> element defines a search landmark. This removes the need
for adding role=search to a <form> element.

Examples

Header search form

This example demonstrates the use of <search> as the container for a
search within a website header to perform a simple site-wide search. The
<search> is a semantic container for the <form> that submits the
user-entered search query to a server.

HTML

html

    <header>
      <h1>Movie website</h1>
      <search>
        <form action="./search/">
          <label for="movie">Find a Movie</label>
          <input type="search" id="movie" name="q" />
          <button type="submit">Search</button>
        </form>
      </search>
    </header>

Result

Web app search

This example demonstrates potential DOM content when dynamically
including JavaScript search functionality in a web application. When
search functionality is implemented entirely with JavaScript, if no form
is submitted, neither a <form> element nor a submit <button> is
required. For semantics, the <search> element is included to contain the
search and filtering capabilities.

HTML

html

    <search>
      <label>
        Find and filter your query
        <input type="search" id="query" />
      </label>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="exact-only" />
        Exact matches only
      </label>

      <section>
        <h3>Results:</h3>
        <ul id="results">
          <!-- search result content -->
        </ul>
        <output id="no-results">
          <!-- no results content -->
        </output>
      </section>
    </search>

Result

Note: Remember that some users don't have JavaScript, and none of your
users have JavaScript running until the JavaScript is successfully
downloaded, parsed, and executed, ensure your users can access the
content of your site with JavaScript disabled.

Multiple searches

This example demonstrates a page with two search features. The first is
a global site search located on the header. The second is a search and
filter based on the page context, in our example a car search.

HTML

html

    <body>
      <header>

        <search title="Cars">
          <h3>Filter results</h3>
          ...
        </search>

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

As mentioned above, <section> is a generic sectioning element, and
should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent
it. As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a <nav>
element, but a list of search results or a map display and its controls
don't have specific elements, and could be put inside a <section>.

Also consider these cases:

-   If the contents of the element represent a standalone, atomic unit
    of content that makes sense syndicated as a standalone piece (e.g. a
    blog post or blog comment, or a newspaper article), the <article>
    element would be a better choice.
-   If the contents represent useful tangential information that works
    alongside the main content, but is not directly part of it (like
    related links, or an author bio), use an <aside>.
-   If the contents represent the main content area of a document, use
    <main>.
-   If you are only using the element as a styling wrapper, use a <div>
    instead.

To reiterate, each <section> should be identified, typically by
including a heading (h1 - h6 element) as a child of the <section>
element, wherever possible. See below for examples of where you might
see a <section> without a heading.

Examples

Simple usage example

Before

html

    <div>
      <h2>Heading</h2>
      <p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
    </div>

Result

After

html

    <section>
      <h2>Heading</h2>
      <p>Bunch of awesome content</p>
    </section>

Result

Using a section without a heading

Circumstances where you might see <section> used without a heading are
typically found in web application/UI sections rather than in
traditional document structures. In a document, it doesn't really make
any sense to have a separate section of content without a heading to
describe its contents. Such headings are useful for all readers, but
particularly useful for users of assistive technologies like screen
readers, and they are also good for SEO.

Consider however a secondary navigation mechanism. If the global
navigation is already wrapped in a <nav> element, you could conceivably
wrap a previous/next menu in a <section>:

html

    <section>
      <a href="#">Previous article</a>
      <a href="#">Next article</a>
    </section>

Or what about some kind of button bar for controlling your app? This
might not necessarily want a heading, but it is still a distinct section
of the document:

html

    <section>
      <button class="reply">Reply</button>

%html-content%

The above example shows typical <select> usage. It is given an id
attribute to enable it to be associated with a <label> for accessibility
purposes, as well as a name attribute to represent the name of the
associated data point submitted to the server. Each menu option is
defined by an <option> element nested inside the <select>.

Each <option> element should have a value attribute containing the data
value to submit to the server when that option is selected. If no value
attribute is included, the value defaults to the text contained inside
the element. You can include a selected attribute on an <option> element
to make it selected by default when the page first loads.

The <select> element has some unique attributes you can use to control
it, such as multiple to specify whether multiple options can be
selected, and size to specify how many options should be shown at once.
It also accepts most of the general form input attributes such as
required, disabled, autofocus, etc.

You can further nest <option> elements inside <optgroup> elements to
create separate groups of options inside the dropdown. You can also
include <hr> elements to create separators that add visual breaks
between options.

For further examples, see The native form widgets: Drop-down content.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

autocomplete

    A string providing a hint for a user agent's autocomplete feature.
    See The HTML autocomplete attribute for a complete list of values
    and details on how to use autocomplete.

autofocus

    This Boolean attribute lets you specify that a form control should
    have input focus when the page loads. Only one form element in a
    document can have the autofocus attribute.

disabled

    This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot interact with
    the control. If this attribute is not specified, the control
    inherits its setting from the containing element, for example
    <fieldset>; if there is no containing element with the disabled
    attribute set, then the control is enabled.

form

    The <form> element to associate the <select> with (its form owner).
    The value of this attribute must be the id of a <form> in the same
    document. (If this attribute is not set, the <select> is associated
    with its ancestor <form> element, if any.)

    This attribute lets you associate <select> elements to <form>s
    anywhere in the document, not just inside a <form>. It can also
    override an ancestor <form> element.

multiple

    This Boolean attribute indicates that multiple options can be
    selected in the list. If it is not specified, then only one option
    can be selected at a time. When multiple is specified, most browsers
    will show a scrolling list box instead of a single line dropdown.

name

    This attribute is used to specify the name of the control.

required

    A Boolean attribute indicating that an option with a non-empty
    string value must be selected.

size

    If the control is presented as a scrolling list box (e.g. when
    multiple is specified), this attribute represents the number of rows
    in the list that should be visible at one time. Browsers are not
    required to present a select element as a scrolled list box. The
    default value is 0.

    Note: According to the HTML specification, the default value for
    size should be 1; however, in practice, this has been found to break
    some websites, and no other browser currently does that, so Mozilla
    has opted to continue to return 0 for the time being with Firefox.

Usage notes

Selecting multiple options

On a desktop computer, there are a number of ways to select multiple
options in a <select> element with a multiple attribute:

Mouse users can hold the Ctrl, Command, or Shift keys (depending on what
makes sense for your operating system) and then click multiple options
to select/deselect them.

Warning: The mechanism for selecting multiple non-contiguous items via
the keyboard described below currently only seems to work in Firefox.

On macOS, the Ctrl + Up and Ctrl + Down shortcuts conflict with the OS
default shortcuts for Mission Control and Application windows, so you'll
have to turn these off before it will work.

Keyboard users can select multiple contiguous items by:

-   Focusing on the <select> element (e.g. using Tab ).
-   Selecting an item at the top or bottom of the range they want to
    select using the Up and Down cursor keys to go up and down the
    options.
-   Holding down the Shift key and then using the Up and Down cursor
    keys to increase or decrease the range of items selected.

Keyboard users can select multiple non-contiguous items by:

-   Focusing on the <select> element (e.g. using Tab ).
-   Holding down the Ctrl key then using the Up and Down cursor keys to
    change the "focused" select option, i.e. the one that will be
    selected if you choose to do so. The "focused" select option is
    highlighted with a dotted outline, in the same way as a
    keyboard-focused link.
-   Pressing Space to select/deselect "focused" select options.

Styling with CSS

The <select> element is notoriously difficult to style productively with
CSS. You can affect certain aspects like any element — for example,
manipulating the box model, the displayed font, etc., and you can use
the appearance property to remove the default system appearance.

However, these properties don't produce a consistent result across
browsers, and it is hard to do things like line different types of form
element up with one another in a column. The <select> element's internal
structure is complex, and hard to control. If you want to get full
control, you should consider using a library with good facilities for
styling form widgets, or try rolling your own dropdown menu using
non-semantic elements, JavaScript, and WAI-ARIA to provide semantics.

For more useful information on styling <select>, see:

-   Styling HTML forms
-   Advanced styling for HTML forms

Also see the "Customizing select styles" example below for an example of
you could attempt a simple <select> styling.

Examples

Basic select

The following example creates a very simple dropdown menu, the second
option of which is selected by default.

html

    <!-- The second value will be selected initially -->
    <select name="choice">
      <option value="first">First Value</option>
      <option value="second" selected>Second Value</option>
      <option value="third">Third Value</option>
    </select>

Result

Select with grouping options

The following example creates a dropdown menu with grouping using
<optgroup> and <hr> to make it easier for the user to understand the
content in the dropdown.

html

    <label for="hr-select">Your favorite food</label> <br />

    <select name="foods" id="hr-select">
      <option value="">Choose a food</option>
      <hr />
      <optgroup label="Fruit">
        <option value="apple">Apples</option>
        <option value="banana">Bananas</option>
        <option value="cherry">Cherries</option>
        <option value="damson">Damsons</option>
      </optgroup>
      <hr />
      <optgroup label="Vegetables">
        <option value="artichoke">Artichokes</option>
        <option value="broccoli">Broccoli</option>
        <option value="cabbage">Cabbages</option>
      </optgroup>
      <hr />
      <optgroup label="Meat">
        <option value="beef">Beef</option>
        <option value="chicken">Chicken</option>
        <option value="pork">Pork</option>
      </optgroup>
      <hr />
      <optgroup label="Fish">
        <option value="cod">Cod</option>
        <option value="haddock">Haddock</option>
        <option value="salmon">Salmon</option>
        <option value="turbot">Turbot</option>
      </optgroup>
    </select>

Result

Advanced select with multiple features

The follow example is more complex, showing off more features you can
use on a <select> element:

html

    <label>
      Please choose one or more pets:
      <select name="pets" multiple size="4">
        <optgroup label="4-legged pets">
          <option value="dog">Dog</option>
          <option value="cat">Cat</option>
          <option value="hamster" disabled>Hamster</option>
        </optgroup>
        <optgroup label="Flying pets">
          <option value="parrot">Parrot</option>
          <option value="macaw">Macaw</option>
          <option value="albatross">Albatross</option>
        </optgroup>
      </select>
    </label>

Result

You'll see that:

-   Multiple options are selectable because we've included the multiple
    attribute.
-   The size attribute causes only 4 lines to display at a time; you can
    scroll to view all the options.
-   We've included <optgroup> elements to divide the options up into
    different groups. This is a purely visual grouping, its
    visualization generally consists of the group name being bolded, and
    the options being indented.
-   The "Hamster" option includes a disabled attribute and therefore
    can't be selected at all.

Customizing select styles

This example shows how you could use some CSS and JavaScript to provide
extensive custom styling for a <select> box.

This example basically:

-   Clones the <select>'s context (the <option> elements) in a parent
    wrapper and reimplements the standard expected behavior using
    additional HTML elements and JavaScript. This includes basic tab
    behavior to provide keyboard accessibility.
-   Maps some standards native attributes to data-attributes of the new
    elements in order to manage state and CSS.

Note: Not all native features are supported, it's a Proof of Concept. IT
starts from standard HTML but the same results can be achieved starting
from JSON data, custom HTML, or other solutions.

Accessibility concerns

The <hr> within a <select> should be considered purely decorative, as
they are currently not exposed within the accessibility tree and
therefore not exposed to assistive technologies.

# <s>: The Strikethrough element#

The <s> HTML element renders text with a strikethrough, or a line
through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer
relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not appropriate when
indicating document edits; for that, use the <del> and <ins> elements,
as appropriate.

Accessibility concerns

The presence of the s element is not announced by most screen reading
technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be announced
by using the CSS content property, along with the ::before and ::after
pseudo-elements.

css

    s::before,
    s::after {
      clip-path: inset(100%);
      clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
      height: 1px;
      overflow: hidden;
      position: absolute;
      white-space: nowrap;
      width: 1px;
    }

    s::before {
      content: " [start of stricken text] ";
    }

    s::after {
      content: " [end of stricken text] ";
    }

Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing
content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important
to not abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not
knowing content has been struck out would adversely affect
understanding.

# <source>: The Media or Image Source element#

The <source> HTML element specifies one or more media resources for the
<picture>, <audio>, and <video> elements. It is a void element, which
means that it has no content and does not require a closing tag. This
element is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple
file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of
browsers given their differing support for image file formats and media
file formats.

Attributes

This element supports all global attributes. In addition, the following
attributes can be used with it:

type

    Specifies the MIME media type of the image or other media type,
    optionally including a codecs parameter.

src

    Specifies the URL of the media resource. Required if the parent of
    <source> is <audio> or <video>. Not allowed if the parent is
    <picture>.

srcset

    Specifies a comma-separated list of one or more image URLs and their
    descriptors. Required if the parent of <source> is <picture>. Not
    allowed if the parent is <audio> or <video>.

    The list consists of strings separated by commas, indicating a set
    of possible images for the browser to use. Each string is composed
    of:

    -   A URL specifying an image location.
    -   An optional width descriptor—a positive integer directly
        followed by "w", such as 300w.
    -   An optional pixel density descriptor—a positive floating number
        directly followed by "x", such as 2x.

    Each string in the list must have either a width descriptor or a
    pixel density descriptor to be valid. These two descriptors should
    not be used together; only one should be used consistently
    throughout the list. The value of each descriptor in the list must
    be unique. The browser chooses the most adequate image to display at
    a given point of time based on these descriptors. If the descriptors
    are not specified, the default value used is 1x. If the sizes
    attribute is also present, then each string must include a width
    descriptor. If the browser does not support srcset, then src will be
    used for the default image source.

sizes

    Specifies a list of source sizes that describe the final rendered
    width of the image. Allowed if the parent of <source> is <picture>.
    Not allowed if the parent is <audio> or <video>.

    The list consists of source sizes separated by commas. Each source
    size is media condition-length pair. Before laying the page out, the
    browser uses this information to determine which image defined in
    srcset to display. Note that sizes will take effect only if width
    descriptors are provided with srcset, not pixel density descriptors
    (i.e., 200w should be used instead of 2x).

media

    Specifies the media query for the resource's intended media.

height

    Specifies the intrinsic height of the image in pixels. Allowed if
    the parent of <source> is a <picture>. Not allowed if the parent is
    <audio> or <video>.

    The height value must be an integer without any units.

width

    Specifies the intrinsic width of the image in pixels. Allowed if the
    parent of <source> is a <picture>. Not allowed if the parent is
    <audio> or <video>.

    The width value must be an integer without any units.

Usage notes

The <source> element is a void element, which means that it not only has
no content but also has no closing tag. That is, you never use
"</source>" in your HTML.

The browser goes through a list of <source> elements to find a format it
supports. It uses the first one it can display. For each <source>
element:

-   If the type attribute isn't specified, the browser retrieves the
    media's type from the server and determines if it can be displayed.
    If the media can't be rendered, the browser checks the next <source>
    in the list.
-   If the type attribute is specified, the browser immediately compares
    it with the media types it can display. If the type is not
    supported, the browser skips querying the server and directly checks
    the next <source> element.

If none of the <source> elements provide a usable source:

-   In the case of a <picture> element, the browser will fall back to
    using the image specified in the <picture> element's <img> child.
-   In the case of an <audio> or <video> element, the browser will fall
    back to displaying the content included between the element's
    opening and closing tags.

For information about image formats supported by web browsers and
guidance on selecting appropriate formats to use, see our Image file
type and format guide. For details on the video and audio media types
you can use, see the Media type and format guide.

Examples

Using the type attribute with <video>

This example demonstrates how to offer a video in different formats:
WebM for browsers that support it, Ogg for those that support Ogg, and
QuickTime for browsers that support QuickTime. If the <audio> or <video>
element is not supported by the browser, a notice is displayed instead.
If the browser supports the element but does not support any of the
specified formats, an error event is raised and the default media
controls (if enabled) will indicate an error. For more details on which
media file formats to use and their browser support, refer to our Media
type and format guide.

html

    <video controls>
      <source src="foo.webm" type="video/webm" />
      <source src="foo.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
      <source src="foo.mov" type="video/quicktime" />
      I'm sorry; your browser doesn't support HTML video.
    </video>

Using the media attribute with <video>

This example demonstrates how to offer an alternate source file for
viewports above a certain width. When a user's browsing environment
meets the specified media condition, the associated <source> element is
chosen. The contents of its src attribute are then requested and
rendered. If the media condition does not match, the browser will move
on to the next <source> in the list. The second <source> option in the
code below has no media condition, so it will be selected for all other
browsing contexts.

html

    <video controls>
      <source src="foo-large.webm" media="(min-width: 800px)" />
      <source src="foo.webm" />
      I'm sorry; your browser doesn't support HTML video.
    </video>

For more examples, the Video and audio content article in the Learn area
is a great resource.

Using the media attribute with <picture>

In this example, two <source> elements are included within <picture>,
providing versions of an image to use when the available space exceeds
certain widths. If the available width is less than the smallest of
these widths, the browser will fall back to the image specified in the
<img> element.

html

    <picture>
      <source srcset="mdn-logo-wide.png" media="(min-width: 800px)" />
      <source srcset="mdn-logo-medium.png" media="(min-width: 600px)" />
      <img src="mdn-logo-narrow.png" alt="MDN Web Docs" />
    </picture>

With the <picture> element, you must always include an <img> with a
fallback image. Also, make sure to add an alt attribute for
accessibility, unless the image is purely decorative and irrelevant to
the content.

Using height and width attributes with <picture>

In this example, three <source> elements with height and width
attributes are included in a <picture> element. A media query allows the
browser to select an image to display with the height and width
attributes based on the viewport size.

html

    <picture>
      <source
        srcset="landscape.png"
        media="(min-width: 1000px)"
        width="1000"
        height="400" />
      <source
        srcset="square.png"
        media="(min-width: 800px)"
        width="800"
        height="800" />
      <source
        srcset="portrait.png"
        media="(min-width: 600px)"
        width="600"
        height="800" />
      <img
        src="fallback.png"
        alt="Image used when the browser does not support the sources"
        width="500"
        height="400" />
    </picture>

# <span>: The Content Span element#

The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing
content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to
group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes),
or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used
only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much
like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a
<span> is an inline-level element.

# <strong>: The Strong Importance element#

The <strong> HTML element indicates that its contents have strong
importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the
contents in bold type.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

The <strong> element is for content that is of "strong importance,"
including things of great seriousness or urgency (such as warnings).
This could be a sentence that is of great importance to the whole page,
or you could merely try to point out that some words are of greater
importance compared to nearby content.

Typically this element is rendered by default using a bold font weight.
However, it should not be used to apply bold styling; use the CSS
font-weight property for that purpose. Use the <b> element to draw
attention to certain text without indicating a higher level of
importance. Use the <em> element to mark text that has stress emphasis.

Another accepted use for <strong> is to denote the labels of paragraphs
which represent notes or warnings within the text of a page.

<b> vs. <strong>

It is often confusing to new developers why there are so many ways to
express the same thing on a rendered website. <b> and <strong> are
perhaps one of the most common sources of confusion, causing developers
to ask "Should I use <b> or <strong>? Don't they both do the same
thing?"

Not exactly. The <strong> element is for content that is of greater
importance, while the <b> element is used to draw attention to text
without indicating that it's more important.

It may help to realize that both are valid and semantic elements in HTML
and that it's a coincidence that they both have the same default styling
(boldface) in most browsers (although some older browsers actually
underline <strong>). Each element is meant to be used in certain types
of scenarios, and if you want to bold text for decoration, you should
instead actually use the CSS font-weight property.

The intended meaning or purpose of the enclosed text should be what
determines which element you use. Communicating meaning is what
semantics are all about.

<em> vs. <strong>

Adding to the confusion is the fact that while HTML 4 defined <strong>
as indicating a stronger emphasis, HTML 5 defines <strong> as
representing "strong importance for its contents." This is an important
distinction to make.

While <em> is used to change the meaning of a sentence as spoken
emphasis does ("I love carrots" vs. "I love carrots"), <strong> is used
to give portions of a sentence added importance (e.g., "Warning! This is
very dangerous.") Both <strong> and <em> can be nested to increase the
relative degree of importance or stress emphasis, respectively.

# <style>: The Style Information element#

The <style> HTML element contains style information for a document, or
part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of
the document containing the <style> element.

    }

Output

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

The <style> element must be included inside the <head> of the document.
In general, it is better to put your styles in external stylesheets and
apply them using <link> elements.

If you include multiple <style> and <link> elements in your document,
they will be applied to the DOM in the order they are included in the
document — make sure you include them in the correct order, to avoid
unexpected cascade issues.

In the same manner as <link> elements, <style> elements can include
media attributes that contain media queries, allowing you to selectively
apply internal stylesheets to your document depending on media features
such as viewport width.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

blocking Experimental

    This attribute explicitly indicates that certain operations should
    be blocked on the fetching of critical subresources. @import-ed
    stylesheets are generally considered as critical subresources,
    whereas background-image and fonts are not.

    -   render: The rendering of content on the screen is blocked.

media

    This attribute defines which media the style should be applied to.
    Its value is a media query, which defaults to all if the attribute
    is missing.

nonce

    A cryptographic nonce (number used once) used to allow inline styles
    in a style-src Content-Security-Policy. The server must generate a
    unique nonce value each time it transmits a policy. It is critical
    to provide a nonce that cannot be guessed as bypassing a resource's
    policy is otherwise trivial.

title

    This attribute specifies alternative style sheet sets.

Deprecated attributes

type Deprecated

    This attribute should not be provided: if it is, the only permitted
    values are the empty string or a case-insensitive match for
    text/css.

Examples

A simple stylesheet

In the following example, we apply a very simple stylesheet to a
document:

html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Test page</title>
        <style>
          p {
            color: red;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>This is my paragraph.</p>
      </body>
    </html>

Result

Multiple style elements

In this example we've included two <style> elements — notice how the
conflicting declarations in the later <style> element override those in
the earlier one, if they have equal specificity.

html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Test page</title>
        <style>
          p {
            color: white;
            background-color: blue;
            padding: 5px;
            border: 1px solid black;
          }
        </style>
        <style>
          p {
            color: blue;
            background-color: yellow;
          }
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>This is my paragraph.</p>
      </body>
    </html>

Result

Including a media query

In this example we build on the previous one, including a media
attribute on the second <style> element so it is only applied when the
viewport is less than 500px in width.

html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Test page</title>
        <style>
          p {
            color: white;
            background-color: blue;
            padding: 5px;
            border: 1px solid black;
          }
        </style>
        <style media="all and (max-width: 500px)">
          p {
            color: blue;
            background-color: yellow;

        sans-serif;
    }

Console Output

%html-content%

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

The <sub> element should be used only for typographical reasons—that is,
to change the position of the text to comply with typographical
conventions or standards, rather than solely for presentation or
appearance purposes.

For example, using <sub> to style the name of a company which uses
altered baselines in their wordmark would not be appropriate; instead,
CSS should be used. For example, you could use the vertical-align
property with a declaration like vertical-align: sub or, to more
precisely control the baseline shift, vertical-align: -25%.

Appropriate use cases for <sub> include (but aren't necessarily limited
to):

-   Marking up footnote numbers. See Footnote numbers for an example.
-   Marking up the subscript in mathematical variable numbers (although
    you may also consider using a MathML formula for this). See Variable
    subscripts.
-   Denoting the number of atoms of a given element within a chemical
    formula (such as every developer's best friend, C ₈ H ₁₀ N ₄ O ₂ ,
    otherwise known as "caffeine"). See Chemical formulas.

Examples

Footnote numbers

Traditional footnotes are denoted using numbers which are rendered in
subscript. This is a common use case for <sub>:

html

    <p>
      According to the computations by Nakamura, Johnson, and Mason<sub>1</sub> this
      will result in the complete annihilation of both particles.
    </p>

Result

Variable subscripts

In mathematics, families of variables related to the same concept (such
as distances along the same axis) are represented using the same
variable name with a subscript following. For example:

html

    <p>
      The horizontal coordinates' positions along the X-axis are represented as
      <var>x<sub>1</sub></var> … <var>x<sub>n</sub></var>.
    </p>

Result

Chemical formulas

When writing a chemical formula, such as H₂0, the number of atoms of a
given element within the described molecule is represented using a
subscripted number; in the case of water, the subscripted "2" indicates
that there are two atoms of hydrogen in the molecule.

Another example:

html

    <p>
      Almost every developer's favorite molecule is
      C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is commonly known
      as "caffeine."

%html-content%

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

The <summary> element's contents can be any heading content, plain text,
or HTML that can be used within a paragraph.

A <summary> element may only be used as the first child of a <details>
element. When the user clicks on the summary, the parent <details>
element is toggled open or closed, and then a toggle event is sent to
the <details> element, which can be used to let you know when this state
change occurs.

The content of the <details> provides the accessible description for the
<summary>.

Default label text

If a <details> element's first child is not a <summary> element, the
user agent will use a default string (typically "Details") as the label
for the disclosure box.

Default style

Per the HTML specification, the default style for <summary> elements
includes display: list-item. This makes it possible to change or remove
the icon displayed as the disclosure widget next to the label from the
default, which is typically a triangle.

You can also change the style to display: block to remove the disclosure
triangle.

See the Browser compatibility section for details, as not all browsers
support full functionality of this element yet.

For Webkit-based browsers, such as Safari, it is possible to control the
icon display through the non-standard CSS pseudo-element
::-webkit-details-marker. To remove the disclosure triangle, use
summary::-webkit-details-marker { display: none }.

Examples

Below are some examples showing <summary> in use. You can find more
examples in the documentation for the <details> element.

Basic example

A simple example showing the use of <summary> in a <details> element:

html

    <details open>
      <summary>Overview</summary>
      <ol>
        <li>Cash on hand: $500.00</li>
        <li>Current invoice: $75.30</li>
        <li>Due date: 5/6/19</li>
      </ol>
    </details>

Result

Summaries as headings

You can use heading elements in <summary>, like this:

html

    <details open>
      <summary><h4>Overview</h4></summary>
      <ol>
        <li>Cash on hand: $500.00</li>
        <li>Current invoice: $75.30</li>
        <li>Due date: 5/6/19</li>
      </ol>
    </details>

Result

This currently has some spacing issues that could be addressed using
CSS.

Warning: Because the <summary> element has a default role of button
(which strips all roles from child elements), this example will not work
for users of assistive technologies such as screen readers. The <h4>
will have its role removed and thus will not be treated as a heading for
these users.

HTML in summaries

This example adds some semantics to the <summary> element to indicate
the label as important:

html

    <details open>
      <summary><strong>Overview</strong></summary>
      <ol>
        <li>Cash on hand: $500.00</li>
        <li>Current invoice: $75.30</li>

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

The <sup> element should only be used for typographical reasons—that is,
to change the position of the text to comply with typographical
conventions or standards, rather than solely for presentation or
appearance purposes.

For example, to style the wordmark of a business or product which uses a
raised baseline should be done using CSS (most likely vertical-align)
rather than <sup>. This would be done using, for example,
vertical-align: super or, to shift the baseline up 50%,
vertical-align: 50%.

Appropriate use cases for <sup> include (but aren't necessarily limited
to):

-   Displaying exponents, such as "x³". It may be worth considering the
    use of MathML for these, especially in more complex cases. See
    Exponents under Examples below.
-   Displaying superior lettering, which is used in some languages when
    rendering certain abbreviations. For example, in French, the word
    "mademoiselle" can be abbreviated "M^(lle)"; this is an acceptable
    use case. See Superior lettering for examples.
-   Representing ordinal numbers, such as "4^(th)" instead of "fourth."
    See Ordinal numbers for examples.

Examples

Exponents

Exponents, or powers of a number, are among the most common uses of
superscripted text. For example:

html

    <p>
      One of the most common equations in all of physics is <var>E</var>=<var>m</var
      ><var>c</var><sup>2</sup>.
    </p>

Result

Superior lettering

Superior lettering is not technically the same thing as superscript.
However, it is common to use <sup> to present superior lettering in
HTML. Among the most common uses of superior lettering is the
presentation of certain abbreviations in French:

html

    <p>Robert a présenté son rapport à M<sup>lle</sup> Bernard.</p>

Result

Ordinal numbers

Ordinal numbers, such as "fourth" in English or "quinto" in Spanish may
be abbreviated using numerals and language-specific text rendered in
superscript:

html

    <p>
      The ordinal number "fifth" can be abbreviated in various languages as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>English: 5<sup>th</sup></li>
      <li>French: 5<sup>ème</sup></li>

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

Deprecated attributes

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are
documented below for reference when updating existing code and for
historical interest only.

align Deprecated

    Specifies the horizontal alignment of the table within its parent
    element. The possible enumerated values are left, center, and right.
    Use the margin-inline-start and margin-inline-end CSS properties
    instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

bgcolor Deprecated

    Defines the background color of the table. The value is an HTML
    color; either a 6-digit hexadecimal RGB code, prefixed by a '#', or
    a color keyword. Other CSS <color> values are not supported. Use the
    background-color CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

border Deprecated

    Defines, as a non-negative integer value (in pixels), the size of
    the frame surrounding the table. If set to 0, the frame attribute is
    set to void. Use the border CSS property instead, as this attribute
    is deprecated.

cellpadding Deprecated

    Defines the space between the content of a cell and its border,
    displayed or not. If the cellpadding's length is defined in pixels,
    this pixel-sized space will be applied to all four sides of the
    cell's content. If the length is defined using a percentage value,
    the content will be centered and the total vertical space (top and
    bottom) will represent this value. The same is true for the total
    horizontal space (left and right). Apply the border-collapse CSS
    property to the <table> element, with its value set to collapse, and
    the padding CSS property to the <td> elements instead, as this
    attribute is deprecated.

cellspacing Deprecated

    Defines the size of the space between two cells in a percentage
    value or pixels. The attribute is applied both horizontally and
    vertically, to the space between the top of the table and the cells
    of the first row, the left of the table and the first column, the
    right of the table and the last column and the bottom of the table
    and the last row. Apply the border-spacing CSS property to the
    <table> element instead, as this attribute is deprecated.
    border-spacing does not have any effect if the border-collapse CSS
    property is set to collapse.

frame Deprecated

    Defines which side of the frame surrounding the table must be
    displayed. The possible enumerated values are void, above, below,
    hsides, vsides, lhs, rhs, box and border. Use the border-style and
    border-width CSS properties instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

rules Deprecated

    Defines where rules (borders) are displayed in the table. The
    possible enumerated values are none (default value), groups
    (<thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> elements), rows (horizontal lines),
    cols (vertical lines), and all (border around every cell). Use the
    border CSS property on the appropriate table-related elements, as
    well as on the <table> itself, instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

summary Deprecated

    Defines an alternative text that summarizes the content of the
    table. Use the <caption> element instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

width Deprecated

    Specifies the width of the table. Use the width CSS property
    instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

    Note: While no HTML specification includes height as a <table>
    attribute, some browsers support a non-standard interpretation of
    height. The unitless value sets a minimum absolute height in pixels.
    If set as a percent value, the minimum table height will be relative
    to the parent container's height. Use the min-height CSS property
    instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

Visual layout of table contents

Following elements are part of the table structure:

-   <caption>
-   <thead>
-   <colgroup>
-   <col>
-   <th>
-   <tbody>
-   <tr>
-   <td>
-   <tfoot>

The <table> box establishes a table formatting context. Elements inside
the <table> generate rectangular boxes. Each box occupies a number of
table cells according to the following rules:

1.  The row boxes fill the table in the source code order from top to
    bottom. Each row box occupies one row of cells.
2.  A row group box occupies one or more row boxes.
3.  Column boxes are placed next to each other in source code order.
    Depending on the value of the dir attribute, the columns are laid in
    left-to-right or right-to-left direction. A column box occupies one
    or more columns of table cells.
4.  A column group box occupies one or more column boxes.
5.  A cell box may span over multiple rows and columns. User agents trim
    cells to fit in the available number of rows and columns.

Table cells do have padding. Boxes that make up a table do not have
margins.

Table layers and transparency

For styling purpose the table elements may be thought of as being put on
six superimposed layers:

[Table element layers]

The background set on an element in one layer will be visible only if
the layers above it have transparent background. A missing cell is
rendered as if an anonymous table-cell box occupied that place.

Examples

The examples below include tables of progressively increasing
complexity. For additional examples, including an in-depth tutorial, see
the HTML tables series in the Learn web development area, where you'll
learn how to use the table elements and their attributes to correctly
structure your tabular data. A Styling tables guide provides table
styling information, including common, useful techniques.

Since the structure of a <table> involves the use of several
table-related HTML elements along with various associated attributes,
the following examples are intended to provide a simplified explanation
that covers the basics and common standards. Additional and more
detailed information can be found on the corresponding linked pages.

These table examples demonstrate how to create an accessible table that
is structured with HTML and styled with CSS.

Because of how HTML tables are structured, the markup can quickly grow.
For this reason, it is important to clearly define the table's purpose
and final appearance to create the appropriate structure. A logical
structure developed with semantic markup is not only easier to style,
but enables useful and accessible tables that can be understood and
navigated by everyone, including search engines and users of assistive
technologies.

The first example is basic, with subsequent examples growing in
complexity. First, we will develop a very basic HTML table structure for
the table. The first two examples contain no table section groups such
as a defined head, body, or foot, and involve no cell spanning or
explicitly defined cell relationships. Not even a caption is provided.
As we work through the examples, they will be progressively enhanced to
include all the table features that a complex data table should possess.

Basic table

This example includes a very basic table with three rows and two
columns. To demonstrate default browser table styles, no CSS has been
included in this example.

HTML

The table rows are defined with <tr> elements, and the columns are
defined with table header and data cells within them. The first row
contains the header cells (<th> elements) that serve as column headers
for the data cells (<td> elements). Each element (<th> or <td>) per row
is in its respective column—that is, the first element of a row is in
the first column, and the second element of that row is in the second
column.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Maria Sanchez</td>
        <td>28</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Michael Johnson</td>
        <td>34</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

Result

There is no custom CSS or user stylesheet applied to this table. The
styling results purely from the user-agent stylesheet.

Expanded table with header cells

This example extends the basic table, extending the content and adding
basic CSS styles.

HTML

The table comprises four rows (<tr> elements) now, with four columns
each. The first row is a row of header cells (The first row contains
only <th> elements). Subsequent rows include a header column (<th>
elements as the first child elements of each row) and three data columns
(<td> elements). As table sectioning elements are not used, the browser
automatically defines the content group structure, i.e., all rows are
wrapped within the body of the table of an implicit <tbody> element.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>ID</th>
        <th>Member Since</th>
        <th>Balance</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Margaret Nguyen</th>
        <td>427311</td>
        <td><time datetime="2010-06-03">June 3, 2010</time></td>
        <td>0.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Edvard Galinski</th>
        <td>533175</td>
        <td><time datetime="2011-01-13">January 13, 2011</time></td>
        <td>37.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Hoshi Nakamura</th>
        <td>601942</td>
        <td><time datetime="2012-07-23">July 23, 2012</time></td>
        <td>15.00</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

With CSS, we provide the basic styling to create lines around the
components of the table to make the data structure clearer. The CSS adds
a solid border around the <table> and around each of the table's cells,
including those specified with both <th> and <td> elements, demarcating
every header and data cells.

css

    table {
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
    }

Result

Specifying table cell relations

Before moving on to extend the table in more advanced ways, it's
advisable to improve accessibility by defining relationships between the
header and data cells (<th> and <td> elements).

HTML

This is accomplished by introducing the scope attribute on the <th>
elements and setting the values to the corresponding col (column) or row
value.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Name</th>
        <th scope="col">ID</th>
        <th scope="col">Member Since</th>
        <th scope="col">Balance</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Margaret Nguyen</th>
        <td>427311</td>
        <td><time datetime="2010-06-03">June 3, 2010</time></td>
        <td>0.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Edvard Galinski</th>
        <td>533175</td>
        <td><time datetime="2011-01-13">January 13, 2011</time></td>
        <td>37.00</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Hoshi Nakamura</th>
        <td>601942</td>
        <td><time datetime="2012-07-23">July 23, 2012</time></td>
        <td>15.00</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

The CSS and visual result are unchanged—the adaptation provides valuable
contextual information for assistive technologies such as screen readers
to help identify which cells the headers relate to.

Note: If the table structure is even more complex, the (additional) use
of the headers attribute on the <th> and <td> elements may improve
accessibility and help assistive technologies identify the relationships
between cells; see Complicated tables.

Explicitly specifying table section groups

In addition to improving accessibility by specifying cell relations, the
semantics of the table can be improved by introducing table section
groups.

HTML

Since the first row (<tr> element) contains only column header cells and
provides the header for the rest of the table's contents, it can be
enclosed in the <thead> element to explicitly specify that row as the
head section of the table. Moreover, what is automatically accomplished
by the browser can also be defined explicitly—the body section of the
table, which contains the main data of the table, is specified by
enclosing the corresponding rows in the <tbody> element. The explicit
use of the <tbody> element helps the browser to create the intended
table structure, avoiding unwanted results.

html

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Name</th>
          <th scope="col">ID</th>
          <th scope="col">Member Since</th>
          <th scope="col">Balance</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Margaret Nguyen</th>
          <td>427311</td>
          <td><time datetime="2010-06-03">June 3, 2010</time></td>
          <td>0.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Edvard Galinski</th>
          <td>533175</td>
          <td><time datetime="2011-01-13">January 13, 2011</time></td>
          <td>37.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Hoshi Nakamura</th>
          <td>601942</td>
          <td><time datetime="2012-07-23">July 23, 2012</time></td>
          <td>15.00</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

Once again, the CSS and visual result are unchanged—specifying such
table section groups provides valuable contextual information for
assistive technologies, including screen readers and search engines, as
well as for styling in the CSS, which will be shown ion a later example.

Column and row spanning

In this example, we extend the table even more by adding a column and
introducing a multi-row head section.

HTML

Building on the table created so far, a new column for a "Membership End
Date" is added in each body row with the <td> element. An additional row
(<tr> element) is also added within the head section (<thead> element)
to introduce a "Membership Dates" header as a heading for the "Joined"
and "Canceled" columns.

The creation of the second header row involves adding colspan and
rowspan attributes to the <th> elements to allocate the header cells to
the correct columns and rows.

html

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col" rowspan="2">Name</th>
          <th scope="col" rowspan="2">ID</th>
          <th scope="col" colspan="2">Membership Dates</th>
          <th scope="col" rowspan="2">Balance</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Joined</th>
          <th scope="col">Canceled</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Margaret Nguyen</th>
          <td>427311</td>
          <td><time datetime="2010-06-03">June 3, 2010</time></td>
          <td>n/a</td>
          <td>0.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Edvard Galinski</th>
          <td>533175</td>
          <td><time datetime="2011-01-13">January 13, 2011</time></td>
          <td><time datetime="2017-04-08">April 8, 2017</time></td>
          <td>37.00</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Hoshi Nakamura</th>
          <td>601942</td>
          <td><time datetime="2012-07-23">July 23, 2012</time></td>
          <td>n/a</td>
          <td>15.00</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    table {
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
    }

Result

The head section now has two rows, one with the headers (<th> elements)
"Name", "ID", "Membership Dates", and "Balance", and a "Membership
Dates" header with two subheaders that are in a second row: "Joined" and
"Canceled". This is accomplished by:

-   The first row's "Name", "ID", and "Balance" header cells span both
    table header rows by using the rowspan attribute, making them each
    two rows tall.
-   The first row's "Membership Dates" header cell spans two columns
    using the colspan attribute, causing it to be two columns wide.
-   The second row contains only the two header cells "Joined" and
    "Canceled" because the other three columns are merged with the cells
    in the first row that span two rows. The two header cells are
    correctly positioned under the "Membership Dates" header.

Table caption and column summary

It's a common and advisable practice to provide a summary for the
table's content, allowing users to quickly determine the table's
relevance. Furthermore, the "Balance" column is summarized by displaying
the sum of the balances of the individual members.

HTML

A table summary is added by using a table caption (<caption> element) as
the first child element of the <table>. The caption provides the
accessible description for the table.

Lastly, a table foot section (<tfoot> element) is added below the body,
with a row that summarizes the "Balance" column by displaying a sum. The
elements and attributes introduced earlier are applied.

html

Basic table styling

Let's apply a basic style to the table to adjust the typeface and add a
background-color to the head and foot rows. The HTML is unchanged this
time, so let's dive right into the CSS.

      </tfoot>
    </table>

CSS

While a font property is added to the <table> element here to set a more
visually appealing typeface (or an abominable sans-serif typeface,
depending on your personal opinion), the interesting part is the second
style, where the <tr> elements located within the <thead> and <tfoot>
are styled adding a light blue background-color. This is a way to
quickly apply a background color to all the cells in specific sections
simultaneously.

css

    table {
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font:
        16px "Open Sans",
        Helvetica,
        Arial,
        sans-serif;
    }

    thead > tr,
    tfoot > tr {
      background-color: rgb(228 240 245);
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
    }

Advanced table styling

Now we'll go all-out, with styles on rows in the header and body areas
both, including alternating row colors, cells with different colors
depending on position within a row, and so forth. Let's take a look at
the result first this time.

Here's what the final table will look like:

There is no change to the HTML again. See what proper preparation of the
HTML structure can do?

        </tr>
      </tfoot>
    </table>

CSS

The CSS is much more involved this time. It's not complicated, but
there's a lot going on. Let's break it down.

Here the border-collapse and border-spacing properties are added to
eliminate spacing between cells and collapse borders that touch one
another to be a single border instead of winding up with double borders.
Additionally, the <caption> is placed at the bottom of the table using
the caption-side property:

css

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border-spacing: 0;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font:
        16px "Open Sans",
        Helvetica,
        Arial,
        sans-serif;
    }

    caption {
      caption-side: bottom;
      padding: 10px;
      font-weight: bold;
    }

Next, the padding property is used to give all the table cells space
around their content. The vertical-align property aligns the content of
the header cells to the bottom of the cell, which can be seen on the
cells in the head that span two rows:

css

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 4px 6px;
    }

    th {
      vertical-align: bottom;
    }

The next CSS rule sets the background-color of all <tr> elements in the
table's head (as specified using <thead>). Then the bottom border of the
head is set to be a two-pixel wide line. Notice, however, that we're
using the :nth-of-type selector to apply the border-bottom property to
the second row in the head. Why? Because the head is made of two rows
that are spanned by some of the cells. That means there are actually two
rows there; applying the style to the first row would not give us the
expected result:

css

    thead > tr {
      background-color: rgb(228 240 245);
    }

    thead > tr:nth-of-type(2) {
      border-bottom: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
    }

Let's style the two header cells "Joined" and "Canceled" with green and
red hues to represent the "good" of a new member and the "bummer" of a
canceled membership. Here we dig into the last row of the table's head
section using the :last-of-type selector and give the first header cell
in it (the "Joined" header) a greenish color, and the second header cell
in it (the "Canceled" header) a reddish hue:

css

    thead > tr:last-of-type > th:nth-of-type(1) {
      background-color: rgb(225 255 225);
    }

    thead > tr:last-of-type > th:nth-of-type(2) {
      background-color: rgb(255 225 225);
    }

Since the first column should stand out as well, some custom styling is
added here too. This CSS rule styles the first header cell in each row
of the table's body with the text-align property to left-justify the
member names, and with a somewhat different background-color:

css

    tbody > tr > th:first-of-type {
      text-align: left;
      background-color: rgb(225 229 244);
    }

It's common to help improve the readability of table data by alternating
row colors—this is sometimes referred to as "zebra striping". Let's add
a bit of background-color to every even row:

css

    tbody > tr:nth-of-type(even) {
      background-color: rgb(237 238 242);
    }

Since it's standard practice to right-justify currency values in tables,
let's do that here. This just sets the text-align property for the last
<td> in each body row to right:

css

    tbody > tr > td:last-of-type {
      text-align: right;
    }

Finally, some styling similar to the head is applied to the foot section
of the table to make it stand out as well:

css

    tfoot > tr {
      border-top: 2px dashed rgb(140 140 140);
      background-color: rgb(228 240 245);
    }

    tfoot th,
    tfoot td {
      text-align: right;
      font-weight: bold;
    }

Displaying large tables in small spaces

A common issue with tables on the web is that they don't natively work
very well on small screens when the amount of content is large, and the
way to make them scrollable isn't obvious, especially when the markup
may come from a CMS and cannot be modified to have a wrapper.

This example provides one way to display tables in small spaces. We've
hidden the HTML content as it is very large, and there is nothing
remarkable about it. The CSS is more useful to inspect in this example.

CSS

When looking at these styles you'll notice that table's display property
has been set to block. While this allows scrolling, the table loses some
of its integrity, and table cells try to become as small as possible. To
mitigate this issue we've set white-space to nowrap on the <tbody>.
However, we don't do this for the <thead> to avoid long titles forcing
columns to be wider than they need to be to display the data.

To keep the table headers on the page while scrolling down we've set
position to sticky on the <th> elements. Note that we have not set
border-collapse to collapse, as if we do the header cannot be separated
correctly from the rest of the table.

Given that the <table> has a fixed size, the overflow set to auto is the
important part here, as it makes the table scrollable.

css

    table,
    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid black;
    }

    table {
      overflow: auto;
      width: 100%;
      max-width: 400px;
      height: 240px;
      display: block;
      margin: 0 auto;
      border-spacing: 0;
    }

    tbody {
      white-space: nowrap;
    }

    th,
    td {
      padding: 5px 10px;
      border-top-width: 0;
      border-left-width: 0;
    }

    th {
      position: sticky;
      top: 0;
      background: #fff;
      vertical-align: bottom;
    }

    th:last-child,
    td:last-child {
      border-right-width: 0;
    }

    tr:last-child td {
      border-bottom-width: 0;

Accessibility concerns

Captions

By supplying a <caption> element whose value clearly and concisely
describes the table's purpose, it helps the people decide if they need
to check the rest of the table content or skip over it.

This helps people navigating with the aid of assistive technology such
as a screen reader, people experiencing low vision conditions, and
people with cognitive concerns.

Scoping rows and columns

The scope attribute on header cells (<th> elements) is redundant in
simple contexts, because scope is inferred. However, some assistive
technologies may fail to draw correct inferences, so specifying header
scope may improve user experiences. In complex tables, scope can be
specified to provide necessary information about the cells related to a
header.

    cells in data tables | W3C Techniques for WCAG 2.0

Complicated tables

Assistive technologies such as screen readers may have difficulty
parsing tables that are so complex that header cells can't be associated
in a strictly horizontal or vertical way. This is typically indicated by
the presence of the colspan and rowspan attributes.

Ideally, consider alternate ways to present the table's content,
including breaking it apart into a collection of smaller, related tables
that don't have to rely on using the colspan and rowspan attributes. In
addition to helping people who use assistive technology understand the
table's content, this may also benefit people with cognitive concerns
who may have difficulty understanding the associations the table layout
is describing.

If the table cannot be broken apart, use a combination of the id and
headers attributes to programmatically associate each table cell with
the header(s) (<th> elements) the cell is associated with.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

Deprecated attributes

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are
documented below for reference when updating existing code and for
historical interest only.

align Deprecated

    Specifies the horizontal alignment of each body cell. The possible
    enumerated values are left, center, right, justify, and char. When
    supported, the char value aligns the textual content on the
    character defined in the char attribute and on offset defined by the
    charoff attribute. Use the text-align CSS property instead, as this
    attribute is deprecated.

bgcolor Deprecated

    Defines the background color of each body cell. The value is an HTML
    color; either a 6-digit hexadecimal RGB code, prefixed by a '#', or
    a color keyword. Other CSS <color> values are not supported. Use the
    background-color CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

char Deprecated

    Specifies the alignment of the content to a character of each body
    cell. Typical values for this include a period (.) when attempting
    to align numbers or monetary values. If align is not set to char,
    this attribute is ignored.

charoff Deprecated

    Specifies the number of characters to offset the body cell content
    from the alignment character specified by the char attribute.

valign Deprecated

    Specifies the vertical alignment of each body cell. The possible
    enumerated values are baseline, bottom, middle, and top. Use the
    vertical-align CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

Usage notes

-   The <tbody> is placed after any <caption>, <colgroup>, and <thead>
    elements.
-   If <tr> elements are specified outside an existing <tbody> element
    as direct children of the <table>, these elements will be
    encapsulated by a separate <tbody> element generated by the browser.
-   It's permitted to use more than one <tbody> per table as long as
    they are all consecutive. This allows to divide the rows (<tr>
    elements) in large tables into sections, each of which may be
    separately formatted if so desired. If not marked up to be
    consecutive elements, browsers will correct this author error,
    ensuring any <thead> and <tfoot> elements are rendered as the first
    and last elements of the table, respectively.
-   Along with its related <thead> and <tfoot> elements, the <tbody>
    element provides useful semantic information and can be used when
    rendering for either screen or print. Specifying such table content
    groups also provides valuable contextual information for assistive
    technologies, including screen readers and search engines.
-   When printing a document, in the case of a multipage table, the
    <thead> and <tfoot> elements usually specify information that
    remains the same—or at least very similar—on each page, while the
    <tbody> element's contents generally will differ from page to page.
-   When a table is presented in a screen context (such as a window)
    that is not large enough to display the entire table, the user agent
    may let the user scroll the contents of the <thead>, <tbody>,
    <tfoot>, and <caption> blocks separately from one another for the
    same parent <table>.

Examples

See <table> for a complete table example introducing common standards
and best practices.

Not specifying a body

This example demonstrates that the browser automatically encapsulates
<tr> elements within a <tbody> element if the rows are not nested within
a table grouping element (<tbody>, <tfoot>, or <thead>) and are, as in
this example, the direct children of the <table> element.

HTML

Here, a very basic table with some table rows (<tr> elements) containing
data (<td> elements) about students is created.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>3741255</td>
        <td>Jones, Martha</td>
        <td>Computer Science</td>
        <td>240</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3971244</td>
        <td>Nim, Victor</td>
        <td>Russian Literature</td>
        <td>220</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4100332</td>
        <td>Petrov, Alexandra</td>
        <td>Astrophysics</td>
        <td>260</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

Note the CSS in the example, where a background-color is specified for
the <tbody> element and the tbody is used as a part of an additional CSS
selector. Alternatively, browser developer tools can be used to check
the presence of the <tbody> element in the DOM.

css

    tbody {
      background-color: #e4f0f5;
    }

    tbody > tr > td:last-of-type {
      width: 60px;
      text-align: center;
    }

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 8px 10px;
    }

Result

Basic body structure

This example extends and enhances the basic table from the previous
example.

HTML

We introduce a table head (<thead> element) and explicitly use a <tbody>
element to structure the table into semantic sections. The table head
contains the column headers (<th> elements). The <tbody> element
represents the body section of the table, which contains a number of
rows (<tr> elements) with the table's main data, which is the data of
each student.

The use of such table content groups and semantic markup is not only
useful for visual presentation (via CSS styling) and contextual
information for assistive technologies; moreover, the explicit use of
the <tbody> element helps the browser to create the intended table
structure, avoiding unwanted results.

html

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Student ID</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Major</th>
          <th>Credits</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>3741255</td>
          <td>Jones, Martha</td>
          <td>Computer Science</td>
          <td>240</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3971244</td>
          <td>Nim, Victor</td>
          <td>Russian Literature</td>
          <td>220</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4100332</td>
          <td>Petrov, Alexandra</td>
          <td>Astrophysics</td>
          <td>260</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

CSS

The CSS is nearly unchanged from the previous example, except for some
basic styling to highlight the table head so that the headers of the
columns stand out from the data in the table body. As in the example
above, the tbody type selector is used to style the body cells.

css

    tbody {
      background-color: #e4f0f5;
    }

    tbody > tr > td:last-of-type {
      text-align: center;
    }

    thead {
      border-bottom: 2px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      background-color: #2c5e77;
      color: #fff;
    }

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 8px 10px;
    }

Result

Multiple bodies

This example extends and enhances the table from the example above even
more by introducing multiple body sections.

Using multiple <tbody> elements allows creating row groupings within a
table. Each table body can potentially have its own head row or rows;
however, there may only be one <thead> element per table! Because of
that, <tr> with <th> elements can be used to create headers within each
<tbody>.

HTML

Building on the table in the previous basic example, more students are
added and, instead of listing each student's major on each row, the
students are grouped by major. Note that each major is enclosed within
its own <tbody> block, with the first row (<tr> element) serving as the
head of the block, displaying the major title within a <th> element that
uses the colspan attribute to span the header across all three columns
of the table. Each remaining row within each major's <tbody> represents
one student.

html

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Student ID</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Credits</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th colspan="3">Computer Science</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3741255</td>
          <td>Jones, Martha</td>
          <td>240</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4077830</td>
          <td>Pierce, Benjamin</td>
          <td>200</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5151701</td>
          <td>Kirk, James</td>
          <td>230</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th colspan="3">Russian Literature</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3971244</td>
          <td>Nim, Victor</td>
          <td>220</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th colspan="3">Astrophysics</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4100332</td>
          <td>Petrov, Alexandra</td>
          <td>260</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>8892377</td>
          <td>Toyota, Hiroko</td>
          <td>240</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

CSS

Most of the CSS is unchanged. However, a slightly more subtle style is
added for header cells contained directly within a <tbody> (as opposed
to those that reside in the <thead>). This is used for the headers
indicating each table section's corresponding major.

css

    tbody > tr > th {
      border-top: 2px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      background-color: #e4f0f5;
      font-weight: normal;
    }

    tbody {
      background-color: whitesmoke;
    }

    thead {
      background-color: #2c5e77;
      color: #fff;
    }

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 6px 8px;
      text-align: left;
    }

    tbody > tr > td:last-of-type {

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

colspan

    Contains a non-negative integer value that indicates how many
    columns the data cell spans or extends. The default value is 1. User
    agents dismiss values higher than 1000 as incorrect, setting to the
    default value (1).

headers

    Contains a list of space-separated strings, each corresponding to
    the id attribute of the <th> elements that provide headings for this
    table cell.

rowspan

    Contains a non-negative integer value that indicates for how many
    rows the data cell spans or extends. The default value is 1; if its
    value is set to 0, it extends until the end of the table grouping
    section (<thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, even if implicitly defined),
    that the cell belongs to. Values higher than 65534 are clipped to
    65534.

Deprecated attributes

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are
documented below for reference when updating existing code and for
historical interest only.

abbr Deprecated

    Contains a short abbreviated description of the data cell's content.
    Some user-agents, such as speech readers, may present this
    description before the content itself. Put the abbreviated content
    inside the cell and place the (longer) description in the title
    attribute, as this attribute is deprecated. Or, preferably, include
    the content within the data cell, and use CSS to visually clip
    overflowing text.

align Deprecated

    Specifies the horizontal alignment of the data cell. The possible
    enumerated values are left, center, right, justify, and char. When
    supported, the char value aligns the textual content on the
    character defined in the char attribute and the offset defined by
    the charoff attribute. Use the text-align CSS property instead, as
    this attribute is deprecated.

axis Deprecated

    Contains a list of space-separated strings, each corresponding to
    the id attribute of a group of cells that the data cell applies to.

bgcolor Deprecated

    Defines the background color of the data cell. The value is an HTML
    color; either a 6-digit hexadecimal RGB code, prefixed by a '#', or
    a color keyword. Other CSS <color> values are not supported. Use the
    background-color CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

char Deprecated

    Specifies the alignment of the content to a character of the data
    cell. Typical values for this include a period (.) when attempting
    to align numbers or monetary values. If align is not set to char,
    this attribute is ignored.

charoff Deprecated

    Specifies the number of characters to offset the data cell content
    from the alignment character specified by the char attribute.

height Deprecated

    Defines a recommended data cell height. Use the height CSS property
    instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

scope Deprecated

    Defines the cells that the header (defined in the <th>) element
    relates to. The possible enumerated values are row, col, rowgroup,
    and colgroup. Only use this attribute with the <th> element to
    define the row or column for which it is a header, as this attribute
    is deprecated for the <td> element.

valign Deprecated

    Specifies the vertical alignment of the data cell. The possible
    enumerated values are baseline, bottom, middle, and top. Use the
    vertical-align CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

width Deprecated

    Defines a recommended data cell width. Use the width CSS property
    instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

Usage notes

-   The <td> may only be used within a <tr> element.
-   When using the colspan and rowspan attributes to span data cells
    across multiple columns and rows, cells without these attributes
    defined (with a default value of 1) are automatically fitted into
    free available spaces in the table structure that span 1x1 cells, as
    illustrated in the following figure: [Illustration demonstrating
    column and row spanning of table cells: cells 1, 3, and 4 spanning
    two rows; cell 2 spanning two columns; cells 5 and 6 fitting into
    the available cells that are the second and third columns in the
    second row]
    Note: These attributes must not be used to overlap cells.

Examples

See <table> for a complete table example introducing common standards
and best practices.

Basic data cells

This example uses <td> elements along with other table-related elements
to introduce a basic table with data about the phonetic alphabet.

HTML

Some table rows (<tr> elements) contain both header cells (<th>
elements) and data cell <td> elements. The <th> element that is the
first child of each row forms the first column of the table, with each
<th> providing the row header for the data cells within that row. Each
corresponding <td> element contains data aligned with its respective
column header and row header cell.

Note: Normally, a table head group with column headers would be
implemented to make it easier to understand the information in the
columns. The <thead> and <tbody> elements would be used to group such
rows of headers and data into the respective table head and body
sections. This is not implemented in this example to focus on the data
cells and reduce the complexity of this example.

      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

Some basic CSS is used to style the table and its cells. CSS attribute
selectors and the :nth-of-type pseudo-class are used to alternate the
appearance of the cells to make the information in the table easier to
understand and identify.

css

    td,
    th {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 8px 10px;
    }

    tr:nth-of-type(odd) td {
      background-color: #eee;
    }

    tr th[scope="row"] {
      background-color: #d6ecd4;
    }

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

Result

Column and row spanning

This example extends and enhances the basic table from the previous
example by adding an additional "ABC" cell.

HTML

An additional data cell (<td> element) is introduced within the first
row (<tr> element). This creates a fourth column in the table.

Using the rowspan attribute, the "ABC" cell is spanned across the first
three rows of the table. The last data cells of the subsequent rows each
span two columns. This is done using the colspan attribute, aligning
them correctly within the table structure. Note that an additional row
(<tr> element) is added to the table to illustrate this.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">A</th>
        <td>Alfa</td>
        <td>AL fah</td>
        <td rowspan="3">ABC</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">B</th>
        <td>Bravo</td>
        <td>BRAH voh</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">C</th>
        <td>Charlie</td>
        <td>CHAR lee</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">D</th>
        <td>Delta</td>
        <td colspan="2">DELL tah</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">E</th>
        <td>Echo</td>
        <td colspan="2">ECK oh</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

The :first-of-type and :last-of-type pseudo-classes are used in the CSS
to select and style the added "ABC" data cell.

css

    tr:first-of-type td:last-of-type {
      width: 60px;
      background-color: #505050;
      color: #fff;
      font-weight: bold;
      text-align: center;
    }

    td,
    th {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 8px 10px;
    }

    tr:nth-of-type(odd) td {
      background-color: #eee;
    }

    tr th[scope="row"] {
      background-color: #d6ecd4;
    }

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

Result

Associate data cells with header cells

For more complex relationships between data cells (<td> elements) and
header cells (<th> elements), using <th> elements with the scope
attribute alone may not be sufficient for assistive technologies,
especially screen readers.

HTML

To improve the accessibility of the previous example and to allow screen
readers, for example, to speak the headers associated with each data
cell, the headers attribute can be introduced along with id attributes.
Each row header cell (<th> element) associated with the "ABC" data cell,
i.e., the letters "A", "B", and "C", is given a unique identifier with
the id attribute. The "ABC" data cell (<td> element) then uses these id
values in a space-separated list for the headers attribute.

Note: It's recommended to use more descriptive and useful values for the
id attribute. Each id in a document must be unique to that document. In
this example, the id values are single characters to maintain focus on
the concept of the headers attribute.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th id="a" scope="row">A</th>
        <td>Alfa</td>
        <td>AL fah</td>
        <td headers="a b c" rowspan="3">ABC</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th id="b" scope="row">B</th>
        <td>Bravo</td>
        <td>BRAH voh</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th id="c" scope="row">C</th>
        <td>Charlie</td>
        <td>CHAR lee</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">D</th>
        <td>Delta</td>
        <td colspan="2">DELL tah</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">E</th>
        <td>Echo</td>
        <td colspan="2">ECK oh</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

Result

While the visual result is unchanged from the previous example table,
each data cell (<td>) is now explicitly associated with its row header
cell (<th>).

# <template>: The Content Template element#

The <template> HTML element serves as a mechanism for holding HTML
fragments, which can either be used later via JavaScript or generated
immediately into shadow DOM.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

shadowrootmode

    Creates a shadow root for the parent element. It is a declarative
    version of the Element.attachShadow() method and accepts the same
    enumerated values.

    open

        Exposes the internal shadow root DOM for JavaScript (recommended
        for most use cases).

    closed

        Hides the internal shadow root DOM from JavaScript.

    Note: This is a feature of the HTML parser that cannot be used
    post-parsing by setting the shadowrootmode attribute through
    JavaScript. Only allowed values will create the shadow root; any
    other values, including empty ones, won't trigger this behavior.

    Note: You may find the non-standard shadowroot attribute in older
    tutorials and examples that used to be supported in Chrome 90-110.
    This attribute has since been removed and replaced by the standard
    shadowrootmode attribute.

Usage notes

There are two main ways to use the <template> element:

1.  By default, the element's content is not rendered, only parsed into
    a document fragment. Using the content property in JavaScript, this
    fragment can be cloned via the cloneNode method and inserted into
    the DOM.
2.  If the element contains the shadowrootmode attribute, the HTML
    parser will immediately generate a shadow DOM. The element is
    replaced in the DOM by its content wrapped in a shadow root.

The corresponding HTMLTemplateElement interface includes a standard
content property (without an equivalent content/markup attribute). This
content property is read-only and holds a DocumentFragment that contains
the DOM subtree represented by the template. Be careful when using the
content property because the returned DocumentFragment can exhibit
unexpected behavior. For more details, see the Avoiding DocumentFragment
pitfalls section below.

Examples

Generating table rows

First we start with the HTML portion of the example.

html

    <table id="producttable">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <td>UPC_Code</td>
          <td>Product_Name</td>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <!-- existing data could optionally be included here -->
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <template id="productrow">
      <tr>
        <td class="record"></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </template>

First, we have a table into which we will later insert content using
JavaScript code. Then comes the template, which describes the structure
of an HTML fragment representing a single table row.

Now that the table has been created and the template defined, we use
JavaScript to insert rows into the table, with each row being
constructed using the template as its basis.

js

    // Test to see if the browser supports the HTML template element by checking
    // for the presence of the template element's content attribute.
    if ("content" in document.createElement("template")) {
      // Instantiate the table with the existing HTML tbody
      // and the row with the template
      const tbody = document.querySelector("tbody");
      const template = document.querySelector("#productrow");

      // Clone the new row and insert it into the table
      const clone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
      let td = clone.querySelectorAll("td");
      td[0].textContent = "1235646565";
      td[1].textContent = "Stuff";

      tbody.appendChild(clone);

      // Clone the new row and insert it into the table
      const clone2 = template.content.cloneNode(true);
      td = clone2.querySelectorAll("td");
      td[0].textContent = "0384928528";
      td[1].textContent = "Acme Kidney Beans 2";

      tbody.appendChild(clone2);
    } else {
      // Find another way to add the rows to the table because
      // the HTML template element is not supported.
    }

The result is the original HTML table, with two new rows appended to it
via JavaScript:

    table {
      background: #000;
    }
    table td {
      background: #fff;
    }

Implementing a declarative shadow DOM

In this example, a hidden support warning is included at the beginning
of the markup. This warning is later set to be displayed via JavaScript
if the browser doesn't support the shadowrootmode attribute. Next, there
are two <article> elements, each containing nested <style> elements with
different behaviors. The first <style> element is global to the whole
document. The second one is scoped to the shadow root generated in place
of the <template> element because of the presence of the shadowrootmode
attribute.

html

    <p hidden>
      ⛔ Your browser doesn't support <code>shadowrootmode</code> attribute yet.
    </p>
    <article>
      <style>
        p {
          padding: 8px;
          background-color: wheat;
        }
      </style>
      <p>I'm in the DOM.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <template shadowrootmode="open">
        <style>
          p {
            padding: 8px;
            background-color: plum;
          }
        </style>
        <p>I'm in the shadow DOM.</p>
      </template>
    </article>

js

    const isShadowRootModeSupported =
      HTMLTemplateElement.prototype.hasOwnProperty("shadowRootMode");

    document
      .querySelector("p[hidden]")
      .toggleAttribute("hidden", isShadowRootModeSupported);

⛔ Your browser doesn't support shadowrootmode attribute yet.

I'm in the DOM.

I'm in the Shadow DOM.

Avoiding DocumentFragment pitfalls

When a DocumentFragment value is passed, Node.appendChild and similar
methods move only the child nodes of that value into the target node.
Therefore, it is usually preferable to attach event handlers to the
children of a DocumentFragment, rather than to the DocumentFragment
itself.

Consider the following HTML and JavaScript:

HTML

html

    <div id="container"></div>

    <template id="template">
      <div>Click me</div>
    </template>

JavaScript

js

    const container = document.getElementById("container");
    const template = document.getElementById("template");

    function clickHandler(event) {
      event.target.append(" — Clicked this div");
    }

    const firstClone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
    firstClone.addEventListener("click", clickHandler);
    container.appendChild(firstClone);

    const secondClone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
    secondClone.children[0].addEventListener("click", clickHandler);
    container.appendChild(secondClone);

Result

Since firstClone is a DocumentFragment, only its children are added to
container when appendChild is called; the event handlers of firstClone
are not copied. In contrast, because an event handler is added to the
first child node of secondClone, the event handler is copied when
appendChild is called, and clicking on it works as one would expect.

# <textarea>: The Textarea element#

The <textarea> HTML element represents a multi-line plain-text editing
control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount
of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form.

The above example demonstrates a number of features of <textarea>:

-   An id attribute to allow the <textarea> to be associated with a
    <label> element for accessibility purposes
-   A name attribute to set the name of the associated data point
    submitted to the server when the form is submitted.
-   rows and cols attributes to allow you to specify an exact size for
    the <textarea> to take. Setting these is a good idea for
    consistency, as browser defaults can differ.
-   Default content entered between the opening and closing tags.
    <textarea> does not support the value attribute.

The <textarea> element also accepts several attributes common to form
<input>s, such as autocapitalize, autocomplete, autofocus, disabled,
placeholder, readonly, and required.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

autocapitalize

    Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if
    so, in what manner. See the autocapitalize global attribute page for
    more information.

autocomplete

    This attribute indicates whether the value of the control can be
    automatically completed by the browser. Possible values are:

    -   off: The user must explicitly enter a value into this field for
        every use, or the document provides its own auto-completion
        method; the browser does not automatically complete the entry.
    -   on: The browser can automatically complete the value based on
        values that the user has entered during previous uses.

    If the autocomplete attribute is not specified on a <textarea>
    element, then the browser uses the autocomplete attribute value of
    the <textarea> element's form owner. The form owner is either the
    <form> element that this <textarea> element is a descendant of or
    the form element whose id is specified by the form attribute of the
    input element. For more information, see the autocomplete attribute
    in <form>.

autocorrect Non-standard

    A string which indicates whether to activate automatic spelling
    correction and processing of text substitutions (if any are
    configured) while the user is editing this textarea. Permitted
    values are:

    on

        Enable automatic spelling correction and text substitutions.

    off

        Disable automatic spelling correction and text substitutions.

autofocus

    This Boolean attribute lets you specify that a form control should
    have input focus when the page loads. Only one form-associated
    element in a document can have this attribute specified.

cols

    The visible width of the text control, in average character widths.
    If it is specified, it must be a positive integer. If it is not
    specified, the default value is 20.

dirname

    This attribute is used to indicate the text directionality of the
    element contents similar to the dirname attribute of the <input>
    element. For more information, see the dirname attribute.

disabled

    This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot interact with
    the control. If this attribute is not specified, the control
    inherits its setting from the containing element, for example
    <fieldset>; if there is no containing element when the disabled
    attribute is set, the control is enabled.

form

    The form element that the <textarea> element is associated with (its
    "form owner"). The value of the attribute must be the id of a form
    element in the same document. If this attribute is not specified,
    the <textarea> element must be a descendant of a form element. This
    attribute enables you to place <textarea> elements anywhere within a
    document, not just as descendants of form elements.

maxlength

    The maximum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the
    user can enter. If this value isn't specified, the user can enter an
    unlimited number of characters.

minlength

    The minimum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) required
    that the user should enter.

name

    The name of the control.

placeholder

    A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control. Carriage
    returns or line-feeds within the placeholder text must be treated as
    line breaks when rendering the hint.

    Note: Placeholders should only be used to show an example of the
    type of data that should be entered into a form; they are not a
    substitute for a proper <label> element tied to the input. See
    <input> labels for a full explanation.

readonly

    This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot modify the
    value of the control. Unlike the disabled attribute, the readonly
    attribute does not prevent the user from clicking or selecting in
    the control. The value of a read-only control is still submitted
    with the form.

required

    This attribute specifies that the user must fill in a value before
    submitting a form.

rows

    The number of visible text lines for the control. If it is
    specified, it must be a positive integer. If it is not specified,
    the default value is 2.

spellcheck

    Specifies whether the <textarea> is subject to spell checking by the
    underlying browser/OS. The value can be:

    -   true: Indicates that the element needs to have its spelling and
        grammar checked.
    -   default : Indicates that the element is to act according to a
        default behavior, possibly based on the parent element's own
        spellcheck value.
    -   false : Indicates that the element should not be spell checked.

wrap

    Indicates how the control should wrap the value for form submission.
    Possible values are:

    -   hard: The browser automatically inserts line breaks (CR+LF) so
        that each line is no longer than the width of the control; the
        cols attribute must be specified for this to take effect
    -   soft: The browser ensures that all line breaks in the entered
        value are a CR+LF pair, but no additional line breaks are added
        to the value.
    -   off Non-standard : Like soft but changes appearance to
        white-space: pre so line segments exceeding cols are not wrapped
        and the <textarea> becomes horizontally scrollable.

    If this attribute is not specified, soft is its default value.

Styling with CSS

<textarea> is a replaced element — it has intrinsic dimensions, like a
raster image. By default, its display value is inline-block. Compared to
other form elements it is relatively easy to style, with its box model,
fonts, color scheme, etc. being easily manipulable using regular CSS.

Styling HTML forms provides some useful tips on styling <textarea>s.

Baseline inconsistency

The HTML specification doesn't define where the baseline of a <textarea>
is, so different browsers set it to different positions. For Gecko, the
<textarea> baseline is set on the baseline of the first line of the
textarea, on another browser it may be set on the bottom of the
<textarea> box. Don't use vertical-align: baseline on it; the behavior
is unpredictable.

Controlling whether a textarea is resizable

In most browsers, <textarea>s are resizable — you'll notice the drag
handle in the right-hand corner, which can be used to alter the size of
the element on the page. This is controlled by the resize CSS property —
resizing is enabled by default, but you can explicitly disable it using
a resize value of none:

css

    textarea {
      resize: none;
    }

Styling valid and invalid values

Valid and invalid values of a <textarea> element (e.g. those within, and
outside the bounds set by minlength, maxlength, or required) can be
highlighted using the :valid and :invalid pseudo-classes. For example,
to give your textarea a different border depending on whether it is
valid or invalid:

css

    textarea:invalid {
      border: 2px dashed red;
    }

    textarea:valid {
      border: 2px solid lime;
    }

The following example shows a very simple textarea, with a set numbers
of rows and columns and some default content.

html

    <textarea name="textarea" rows="10" cols="50">Write something here</textarea>

Result

Example using "minlength" and "maxlength"

This example has a minimum and maximum number of characters — of 10 and
20 respectively. Try it and see.

html

    <textarea name="textarea" rows="5" cols="30" minlength="10" maxlength="20">
    Write something here…
    </textarea>

Result

Note that minlength doesn't stop the user from removing characters so
that the number entered goes past the minimum, but it does make the
value entered into the <textarea> invalid. Also note that even if you
have a minlength value set (3, for example), an empty <textarea> is
still considered valid unless you also have the required attribute set.

Example using "placeholder"

This example has a placeholder set. Notice how it disappears when you
start typing into the box.

html

    <textarea
      name="textarea"
      rows="5"
      cols="30"
      placeholder="Comment text."></textarea>

Result

Note: Placeholders should only be used to show an example of the type of
data that should be entered into a form; they are not a substitute for a
proper <label> element tied to the input. See <input> labels for a full
explanation.

Disabled and readonly

This example shows two <textarea>s — one of which is disabled, and one
of which is readonly. Have a play with both and you'll see the
difference in behavior — the disabled element is not selectable in any
way (and its value is not submitted), whereas the readonly element is
selectable and its contents copyable (and its value is submitted); you
just can't edit the contents.

Note: In browsers other than Firefox, such as chrome, the disabled
textarea content may be selectable and copyable.

html

    <textarea name="textarea" rows="5" cols="30" disabled>
    I am a disabled textarea.
    </textarea>
    <textarea name="textarea" rows="5" cols="30" readonly>
    I am a read-only textarea.
    </textarea>

# <tfoot>: The Table Foot element#

The <tfoot> HTML element encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr>
elements), indicating that they comprise the foot of a table with
information about the table's columns. This is usually a summary of the
columns, e.g., a sum of the given numbers in a column.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

Deprecated attributes

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are
documented below for reference when updating existing code and for
historical interest only.

align Deprecated

    Specifies the horizontal alignment of each foot cell. The possible
    enumerated values are left, center, right, justify, and char. When
    supported, the char value aligns the textual content on the
    character defined in the char attribute and on offset defined by the
    charoff attribute. Use the text-align CSS property instead, as this
    attribute is deprecated.

bgcolor Deprecated

    Defines the background color of each foot cell. The value is an HTML
    color; either a 6-digit hexadecimal RGB code, prefixed by a '#', or
    a color keyword. Other CSS <color> values are not supported. Use the
    background-color CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

char Deprecated

    Specifies the alignment of the content to a character of each foot
    cell. Typical values for this include a period (.) when attempting
    to align numbers or monetary values. If align is not set to char,
    this attribute is ignored.

charoff Deprecated

    Specifies the number of characters to offset the foot cell content
    from the alignment character specified by the char attribute.

valign Deprecated

    Specifies the vertical alignment of each foot cell. The possible
    enumerated values are baseline, bottom, middle, and top. Use the
    vertical-align CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

Usage notes

-   The <tfoot> is placed after any <caption>, <colgroup>, <thead>,
    <tbody>, and <tr> elements.
-   Along with its related <thead> and <tbody> elements, the <tfoot>
    element provides useful semantic information and can be used when
    rendering for either screen or print. Specifying such table content
    groups also provides valuable contextual information for assistive
    technologies, including screen readers and search engines.
-   When printing a document, in the case of a multipage table, the
    table foot usually specifies information that is output as an
    intermediate summary on each page.

Example

See <table> for a complete table example introducing common standards
and best practices.

This example demonstrates a table divided into a head section with
column headers, a body section with the table's main data, and a foot
section summarizing data of one column.

HTML

The <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> elements are used to structure a basic
table into semantic sections. The <tfoot> element represents the foot
section of the table, which contains a row (<tr>) representing the
calculated average of the values in the "Credits" column.

To allocate the cells in the foot to the correct columns, the colspan
attribute is used on the <th> element to span row header cell across the
first three table columns. The single data cell (<td>) in the foot is
automatically placed in the correct location, i.e., the fourth column,
with the omitted colspan attribute value defaulting to 1. Additionally,
the scope attribute is set to row on the header cell (<th>) in the foot
to explicitly define that this foot header cell relates to the table
cells within the same row, which in our example is the one data cell in
the foot row that contains the calculated average.

html

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Student ID</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Major</th>
          <th>Credits</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>3741255</td>
          <td>Jones, Martha</td>
          <td>Computer Science</td>
          <td>240</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3971244</td>
          <td>Nim, Victor</td>
          <td>Russian Literature</td>
          <td>220</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4100332</td>
          <td>Petrov, Alexandra</td>
          <td>Astrophysics</td>
          <td>260</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
      <tfoot>
        <tr>
          <th colspan="3" scope="row">Average Credits</th>
          <td>240</td>
        </tr>
      </tfoot>
    </table>

CSS

Some basic CSS is used to style and highlight the table foot so that the
foot cells stand out from the data in the table body.

css

    tfoot {
      border-top: 3px dotted rgb(160 160 160);
      background-color: #2c5e77;

Multiple head rows

This example demonstrates a table head section with two rows.

HTML

We extend the markup the table from the basic example in this example by
including two table rows (<tr>) within the <thead> element creating a
multi-row table head. We included an additional column, splitting the
student names into first and last names.

html

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th rowspan="2">Student ID</th>
          <th colspan="2">Student</th>
          <th rowspan="2">Major</th>
          <th rowspan="2">Credits</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>First name</th>
          <th>Last name</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>3741255</td>
          <td>Martha</td>
          <td>Jones</td>
          <td>Computer Science</td>
          <td>240</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3971244</td>
          <td>Victor</td>
          <td>Nim</td>
          <td>Russian Literature</td>
          <td>220</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4100332</td>
          <td>Alexandra</td>
          <td>Petrov</td>
          <td>Astrophysics</td>
          <td>260</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

Cell spanning

In order to associate and line up the header cells with the correct
columns and rows, the colspan and rowspan attributes are used on the
<th> elements. The values set in these attributes specify how many cells
each header cell (<th>) spans. Due to the way these attributes are set,
the two second-row header cells are lined up with the columns they head.
These each span one row and one column as the default values for the
colspan and rowspan attributes are both 1.

The column and row spanning demonstrated by this example are illustrated
in the following figure:

[Illustration demonstrating column and row spanning of table cells:
cells 1, 3, and 4 spanning one column and two rows each; cell 2 spanning
two columns and one row; cells 5 and 6 span a single row and column
each, fitting into the available cells that are the second and third
columns in the second row]

CSS

The CSS is unchanged from the previous example.

      border-bottom: 2px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      background-color: #2c5e77;

# <th>: The Table Header element#

The <th> HTML element defines a cell as the header of a group of table
cells and may be used as a child of the <tr> element. The exact nature
of this group is defined by the scope and headers attributes.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

abbr

    A short, abbreviated description of the header cell's content
    provided as an alternative label to use for the header cell when
    referencing the cell in other contexts. Some user-agents, such as
    speech readers, may present this description before the content
    itself.

colspan

    A non-negative integer value indicating how many columns the header
    cell spans or extends. The default value is 1. User agents dismiss
    values higher than 1000 as incorrect, defaulting such values to 1.

headers

    A list of space-separated strings corresponding to the id attributes
    of the <th> elements that provide the headers for this header cell.

rowspan

    A non-negative integer value indicating how many rows the header
    cell spans or extends. The default value is 1; if its value is set
    to 0, the header cell will extends to the end of the table grouping
    section (<thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, even if implicitly defined),
    that the <th> belongs to. Values higher than 65534 are clipped at
    65534.

scope

    Defines the cells that the header (defined in the <th>) element
    relates to. Possible enumerated values are:

    -   row: the header relates to all cells of the row it belongs to;
    -   col: the header relates to all cells of the column it belongs
        to;
    -   rowgroup: the header belongs to a rowgroup and relates to all of
        its cells;
    -   colgroup: the header belongs to a colgroup and relates to all of
        its cells.

    If the scope attribute is not specified, or its value is not row,
    col, rowgroup, or colgroup, then browsers automatically select the
    set of cells to which the header cell applies.

Deprecated attributes

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are
documented below for reference when updating existing code and for
historical interest only.

align Deprecated

    Specifies the horizontal alignment of the header cell. The possible
    enumerated values are left, center, right, justify, and char. When
    supported, the char value aligns the textual content on the
    character defined in the char attribute and the offset defined by
    the charoff attribute. Use the text-align CSS property instead, as
    this attribute is deprecated.

axis Deprecated

    Contains a list of space-separated strings, each corresponding to
    the id attribute of a group of cells that the header cell applies
    to. Use the scope attribute instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

bgcolor Deprecated

    Defines the background color of the header cell. The value is an
    HTML color; either a 6-digit hexadecimal RGB code, prefixed by a
    '#', or a color keyword. Other CSS <color> values are not supported.
    Use the background-color CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

char Deprecated

    Specifies the alignment of the content to a character of the header
    cell. Typical values for this include a period (.) when attempting
    to align numbers or monetary values. If align is not set to char,
    this attribute is ignored.

charoff Deprecated

    Specifies the number of characters to offset the header cell content
    from the alignment character specified by the char attribute.

height Deprecated

    Defines a recommended header cell height. Use the height CSS
    property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

valign Deprecated

    Specifies the vertical alignment of the header cell. The possible
    enumerated values are baseline, bottom, middle, and top. Use the
    vertical-align CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

width Deprecated

    Defines a recommended header cell width. Use the width CSS property
    instead, as this attribute is deprecated.

Usage notes

-   The <th> may only be used within a <tr> element.
-   In simple contexts, using the scope attribute on header cells (<th>
    elements) is redundant because scope is inferred. However, certain
    assistive technologies may fail to infer correctly, so specifying
    header scope may improve user experiences.
-   When using the colspan and rowspan attributes to span header cells
    across multiple columns and rows, cells without these attributes
    defined (with a default value of 1) are automatically fitted into
    free available spaces in the table structure that span 1x1 cells, as
    illustrated in the following figure: [Illustration demonstrating
    column and row spanning of table cells: cells 1, 3, and 4 spanning
    two rows; cell 2 spanning two columns; cells 5 and 6 fitting into
    the available cells that are the second and third columns in the
    second row]
    Note: These attributes must not be used to overlap cells.

Examples

See <table> for a complete table example introducing common standards
and best practices.

Basic column and row headers

This example uses <th> elements to introduce column and row headers in a
basic table structure.

HTML

The first row (<tr> element) contains the column headers (<th>
elements), which act as "titles" for the columns to make it easier to
understand the information in the columns and identify the data. To
indicate that each column header relates to all cells in the
corresponding column, the scope attribute is set to col (column).

The remaining rows contain the main data of the table. Each of these
rows has a row header (<th> element) introduced as the first cell. This
creates a column with row headers as the first column of the table.
Similar to the column headers, the scope attribute is set to row to
specify which cells each row header relates to, which in the example
below are all data cells (<td> elements) in each row.

Note: Normally, the grouping elements <thead> and <tbody> are used to
group rows with headers into the respective table head and body
sections. These elements are omitted in this example to reduce
complexity and enable focusing on the use of header cells.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Symbol</th>
        <th scope="col">Code word</th>
        <th scope="col">Pronunciation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">A</th>
        <td>Alfa</td>
        <td>AL fah</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">B</th>
        <td>Bravo</td>
        <td>BRAH voh</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">C</th>
        <td>Charlie</td>
        <td>CHAR lee</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">D</th>
        <td>Delta</td>
        <td>DELL tah</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

Some basic CSS is used to style the table and its cells. We use CSS
attribute selectors to target header cells based on their scope
attribute values, highlighting column and row headers (<th> elements)
and differentiating them each other and from the data cells (<td>).

css

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 8px 10px;
    }

    th[scope="col"] {
      background-color: #505050;
      color: #fff;
    }

    th[scope="row"] {
      background-color: #d6ecd4;
    }

    tr:nth-of-type(odd) td {
      background-color: #eee;
    }

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

Result

Column and row spanning

This example extends and enhances the basic table from the previous
example by adding a second row for additional column headers.

HTML

An additional table row (<tr> element) is added as the second header row
of the table with two additional column headers (<th> elements). In this
way, the "Pronunciation" column is split into two columns, one for the
IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) notation and one for the
respelling (the original pronunciation column). The corresponding data
cells (<td> elements) are added to each subsequent row.

As shown in the usage notes, the colspan and rowspan attributes can be
used for the <th> elements to allocate the header cells to the correct
columns and rows. To achieve a "two-row" header in the table structure,
the first two header cells within the first <tr> element are spanned
across two rows. The third header cell is spanned two columns wide
(remaining in the first row). This setup leaves two available areas in
the third and fourth columns in the second row, where the two headers
within the second <tr> element are automatically placed, with the
default value being 1 for the colspan and rowspan attributes.

Note: Normally, <thead> and <tbody> elements are used to group rows with
headers into the respective table head and body sections. This is not
implemented in this example to focus on the headers and spanning and
reduce the example's complexity.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" rowspan="2">Symbol</th>
        <th scope="col" rowspan="2">Code word</th>
        <th scope="col" colspan="2">Pronunciation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">IPA</th>
        <th scope="col">Respelling</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">A</th>
        <td>Alfa</td>
        <td>ˈælfa</td>
        <td>AL fah</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">B</th>
        <td>Bravo</td>
        <td>ˈbraːˈvo</td>
        <td>BRAH voh</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">C</th>
        <td>Charlie</td>
        <td>ˈtʃɑːli</td>
        <td>CHAR lee</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">D</th>
        <td>Delta</td>
        <td>ˈdeltɑ</td>
        <td>DELL tah</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

The CSS is unchanged from the previous example.

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 8px 10px;
    }

    th[scope="col"] {
      background-color: #505050;
      color: #fff;
    }

    th[scope="row"] {
      background-color: #d6ecd4;
    }

    tr:nth-of-type(odd) td {
      background-color: #eee;
    }

Result

Associate header cells with other header cells

For more complex relationships between header cells, using th elements
with the scope attribute alone may not be sufficient for assistive
technologies, especially screen readers.

HTML

To improve the accessibility of the previous example and to allow screen
readers, for example, to speak the headers associated with each header
cell, the headers attribute can be introduced along with id attributes.
Because of the way the "Pronunciation" column is split into two columns
in the example, introducing a "two row" header, assistive technologies
such as screen readers may not be able to identify which additional
header cells (th elements) the "Pronunciation" header cell is related to
and vice versa. Therefore, the headers attribute is used on the
"Pronunciation", "IPA", and "Respelling" header cells to associate the
related header cells based on the values of the unique identifiers from
the added id attributes in the form of a space-separated list.

Note: It's recommended to use more descriptive and useful values for the
id attribute. Each id in a document must be unique to that document. In
this example, the id values are single characters to maintain focus on
the concept of the headers attribute.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" rowspan="2">Symbol</th>
        <th scope="col" rowspan="2">Code word</th>
        <th scope="col" colspan="2" id="p" headers="i r">Pronunciation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" id="i" headers="p">IPA</th>
        <th scope="col" id="r" headers="p">Respelling</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">A</th>
        <td>Alfa</td>
        <td>ˈælfa</td>
        <td>AL fah</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">B</th>
        <td>Bravo</td>
        <td>ˈbraːˈvo</td>
        <td>BRAH voh</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">C</th>
        <td>Charlie</td>
        <td>ˈtʃɑːli</td>
        <td>CHAR lee</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">D</th>
        <td>Delta</td>
        <td>ˈdeltɑ</td>
        <td>DELL tah</td>
      </tr>

# <time>: The (Date) Time element#

The <time> HTML element represents a specific period in time. It may
include the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable
format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features
such as reminders.

It may represent one of the following:

-   A time on a 24-hour clock.
-   A precise date in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and
    timezone information).
-   A valid time duration.

Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global
attributes.

datetime

    This attribute indicates the time and/or date of the element and
    must be in one of the formats described below.

Usage notes

This element is for presenting dates and times in a machine-readable
format. For example, this can help a user agent offer to add an event to
a user's calendar.

This element should not be used for dates prior to the introduction of
the Gregorian calendar (due to complications in calculating those
dates).

The datetime value (the machine-readable value of the datetime) is the
value of the element's datetime attribute, which must be in the proper
format (see below). If the element does not have a datetime attribute,
it must not have any element descendants, and the datetime value is the
element's child text content.

Page titles and SEO

The contents of a page title can have significant implications for
search engine optimization (SEO). In general, a longer, descriptive
title performs better than short or generic titles. The content of the
title is one of the components used by search engine algorithms to
decide the order in which to list pages in search results. Also, the
title is the initial "hook" by which you grab the attention of readers
glancing at the search results page.

A few guidelines and tips for composing good titles:

-   Avoid one- or two-word titles. Use a descriptive phrase, or a
    term-definition pairing for glossary or reference-style pages.
-   Search engines typically display about the first 55–60 characters of
    a page title. Text beyond that may be lost, so try not to have
    titles longer than that. If you must use a longer title, make sure
    the important parts come earlier and that nothing critical is in the
    part of the title that is likely to be dropped.
-   Don't use "keyword blobs." If your title is just a list of words,
    algorithms often reduce your page's position in the search results.
-   Try to make sure your titles are as unique as possible within your
    own site. Duplicate—or near-duplicate—titles can contribute to
    inaccurate search results.

Examples

html

    <title>Awesome interesting stuff</title>

This example establishes a page whose title (as displayed at the top of
the window or in the window's tab) as "Awesome interesting stuff".

Accessibility concerns

It is important to provide an accurate and concise title to describe the
page's purpose.

A common navigation technique for users of assistive technology is to
read the page title and infer the content the page contains. This is
because navigating into a page to determine its content can be a
time-consuming and potentially confusing process. Titles should be
unique to every page of a website, ideally surfacing the primary purpose
of the page first, followed by the name of the website. Following this
pattern will help ensure that the primary purpose of the page is
announced by a screen reader first. This provides a far better
experience than having to listen to the name of a website before the
unique page title, for every page a user navigates to in the same
website.

Examples

html

    <title>Menu - Blue House Chinese Food - FoodYum: Online takeout today!</title>

If a form submission contains errors and the submission re-renders the
current page, the title can be used to help make users aware of any
errors with their submission. For instance, update the page title value
to reflect significant page state changes (such as form validation
problems).

html

    <title>
      2 errors - Your order - Sea Food Store - Food: Online takeout today!
    </title>

Note: Presently, dynamically updating a page's title will not be
automatically announced by screen readers. If you are going to update
the page title to reflect significant changes to a page's state, then
the use of ARIA Live Regions may be necessary, as well.

# <track>: The Embed Text Track element#

The <track> HTML element is used as a child of the media elements,
<audio> and <video>. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or
time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The
tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files) — Web Video Text
Tracks.

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

default

    This attribute indicates that the track should be enabled unless the
    user's preferences indicate that another track is more appropriate.
    This may only be used on one track element per media element.

kind

    How the text track is meant to be used. If omitted the default kind
    is subtitles. If the attribute contains an invalid value, it will
    use metadata (Versions of Chrome earlier than 52 treated an invalid
    value as subtitles). The following keywords are allowed:

    -   subtitles
        -   Subtitles provide translation of content that cannot be
            understood by the viewer. For example speech or text that is
            not English in an English language film.
        -   Subtitles may contain additional content, usually extra
            background information. For example the text at the
            beginning of the Star Wars films, or the date, time, and
            location of a scene.
    -   captions
        -   Closed captions provide a transcription and possibly a
            translation of audio.
        -   It may include important non-verbal information such as
            music cues or sound effects. It may indicate the cue's
            source (e.g. music, text, character).
        -   Suitable for users who are deaf or when the sound is muted.
    -   descriptions
        -   Textual description of the video content.
        -   Suitable for users who are blind or where the video cannot
            be seen.
    -   chapters
        -   Chapter titles are intended to be used when the user is
            navigating the media resource.
    -   metadata
        -   Tracks used by scripts. Not visible to the user.

label

    A user-readable title of the text track which is used by the browser
    when listing available text tracks.

src

    Address of the track (.vtt file). Must be a valid URL. This
    attribute must be specified and its URL value must have the same
    origin as the document — unless the <audio> or <video> parent
    element of the track element has a crossorigin attribute.

srclang

    Language of the track text data. It must be a valid BCP 47 language
    tag. If the kind attribute is set to subtitles, then srclang must be
    defined.

Usage notes

Track data types

The type of data that track adds to the media is set in the kind
attribute, which can take values of subtitles, captions, descriptions,
chapters or metadata. The element points to a source file containing
timed text that the browser exposes when the user requests additional
data.

A media element cannot have more than one track with the same kind,
srclang, and label.

Detecting cue changes

The underlying TextTrack, indicated by the track property, receives a
cuechange event every time the currently-presented cue is changed. This
happens even if the track isn't associated with a media element.

If the track is associated with a media element, using the <track>
element as a child of the <audio> or <video> element, the cuechange
event is also sent to the HTMLTrackElement.

js

    let textTrackElem = document.getElementById("texttrack");

    textTrackElem.addEventListener("cuechange", (event) => {
      let cues = event.target.track.activeCues;
    });

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

Deprecated attributes

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are
documented below for reference when updating existing code and for
historical interest only.

align Deprecated

    Specifies the horizontal alignment of each row cell. The possible
    enumerated values are left, center, right, justify, and char. When
    supported, the char value aligns the textual content on the
    character defined in the char attribute and on offset defined by the
    charoff attribute. Use the text-align CSS property instead, as this
    attribute is deprecated.

bgcolor Deprecated

    Defines the background color of each row cell. The value is an HTML
    color; either a 6-digit hexadecimal RGB code, prefixed by a '#', or
    a color keyword. Other CSS <color> values are not supported. Use the
    background-color CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

char Deprecated

    Specifies the alignment of the content to a character of each row
    cell. Typical values for this include a period (.) when attempting
    to align numbers or monetary values. If align is not set to char,
    this attribute is ignored.

charoff Deprecated

    Specifies the number of characters to offset the row cell content
    from the alignment character specified by the char attribute.

valign Deprecated

    Specifies the vertical alignment of each row cell. The possible
    enumerated values are baseline, bottom, middle, and top. Use the
    vertical-align CSS property instead, as this attribute is
    deprecated.

Usage notes

-   The <tr> may be placed as a direct child of its parent <table>
    element, but only if the <table> has no child <tbody> elements, and
    only after any <caption>, <colgroup>, and <thead> elements.
    Otherwise, the parent must be a <thead>, <tbody>, or <tfoot>
    element.
-   The CSS pseudo-classes :nth-of-type, :first-of-type, and
    :last-of-type are often useful for selecting the desired set of rows
    and their data and header cells (<td> and <th> elements).

Examples

See <table> for a complete table example introducing common standards
and best practices.

Basic row setup

This example demonstrates a table with four rows and three columns,
where the first column contains headers for the row data cells.

HTML

Four <tr> elements are used to create four table rows. Each row contains
three cells - one header cell (<th>) and two data cells (<td>) -
creating three columns. The scope attribute set on each header cell
specifies which cells they relate to, which in this example is all data
cells within the row.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">A</th>
        <td>Alfa</td>
        <td>AL fah</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">B</th>
        <td>Bravo</td>
        <td>BRAH voh</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">C</th>
        <td>Charlie</td>
        <td>CHAR lee</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">D</th>
        <td>Delta</td>
        <td>DELL tah</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

The CSS :nth-of-type pseudo-class is used to select every odd row and
set the background-color of those rows to a slightly darker tone,
creating a so-called "zebra stripe" effect. This alternating background
makes the rows of data in the table easier to parse and read—imagine
having many rows and columns and trying to find some data in a
particular row. In addition, the row header cells (<th> elements) are
highlighted with a background-color to distinguish them from the data
cells (<td> elements).

css

    tr:nth-of-type(odd) {
      background-color: #eee;
    }

    tr th[scope="row"] {
      background-color: #d6ecd4;
    }

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 8px 10px;
    }

Result

Header row

This example extends the basic table from the previous example by adding
a header row as the first row of the table.

HTML

An additional table row (<tr>) is added as the first row of the table
with column header cells (<th>) providing a header for each column. We
put this row in a <thead> grouping element to indicate this is the
header of the table. The scope attribute is added to each header cell
(<th>) within this head row to explicitly specify that each header cell
relates to all the cells within its own column, even though those cells
are in the <tbody>.

html

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Symbol</th>
        <th scope="col">Code word</th>
        <th scope="col">Pronunciation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">A</th>
        <td>Alfa</td>
        <td>AL fah</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">B</th>
        <td>Bravo</td>
        <td>BRAH voh</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">C</th>
        <td>Charlie</td>
        <td>CHAR lee</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">D</th>
        <td>Delta</td>
        <td>DELL tah</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

CSS

The CSS is nearly unchanged from the previous example, except for some
additional styling to highlight the "header row" so that the headers of
the columns stand out from the other cells.

css

    tr:nth-of-type(odd) {
      background-color: #eee;
    }

    tr th[scope="col"] {
      background-color: #505050;
      color: #fff;
    }

    tr th[scope="row"] {
      background-color: #d6ecd4;
    }

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 8px 10px;
    }

Result

Sorting rows

There are no native methods for sorting the rows (<tr> elements) of a
<table>. But using Array.prototype.sort(), Node.removeChild, and
Node.appendChild, a custom sort() function can be implemented in
JavaScript to sort an HTMLCollection of <tr> elements.

HTML

A <tbody> element is used in this basic table to mark the body section
of the table and to include three rows (<tr> elements) with data (<td>
elements), creating one column with numbers in descending order.

html

    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

JavaScript

In the JavaScript code below, the created sort() function is attached to
the <tbody> element so that it sorts the table cells in order of
increasing value and updates the display accordingly.

js

    HTMLTableSectionElement.prototype.sort = function (cb) {
      Array.from(this.rows)
        .sort(cb)
        .forEach((e) => this.appendChild(this.removeChild(e)));
    };

    document
      .querySelector("table")
      .tBodies[0].sort((a, b) => a.textContent.localeCompare(b.textContent));

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 4px 8px;
    }

Result

Sorting rows with a click on header cells

This example extends the basic table from the previous example by making
the sorting interactive and independent for multiple columns.

HTML

An additional data cell (<td> element) is added to each row (<tr>
element) within the table body (<tbody> element) to create a second
column with letters in ascending order. Using the <thead> element, a
head section is added before the body section to introduce a head row
with table header cells (<th> element). These header cells are used in
the JavaScript code below to make them clickable and then to perform the
corresponding sorting when activated per click.

html

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Numbers</th>
          <th>Letters</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>B</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>C</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

JavaScript

A click event handler is added to each table header (<th> element) of
each <table> in the document; it sorts all the rows (<tr> elements) of
the <tbody> based on the contents of the data cells (<td> elements)
contained in the rows.

Note: This solution assumes that the <td> elements are populated by raw
text with no descendant elements.

js

    const allTables = document.querySelectorAll("table");

    for (const table of allTables) {
      const tBody = table.tBodies[0];
      const rows = Array.from(tBody.rows);
      const headerCells = table.tHead.rows[0].cells;

      for (const th of headerCells) {
        const cellIndex = th.cellIndex;

        th.addEventListener("click", () => {
          rows.sort((tr1, tr2) => {
            const tr1Text = tr1.cells[cellIndex].textContent;
            const tr2Text = tr2.cells[cellIndex].textContent;
            return tr1Text.localeCompare(tr2Text);
          });

          tBody.append(...rows);
        });
      }
    }

    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      border: 2px solid rgb(140 140 140);
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 0.8rem;
      letter-spacing: 1px;
    }

    th,
    td {
      border: 1px solid rgb(160 160 160);
      padding: 4px 8px;
    }

    th {
      background-color: #505050;
      color: #fff;
      cursor: pointer;
    }

Result

Note: To be usable and accessible, the header cell of each sortable
column must be identifiable as a sorting button and each must define
whether the column is currently sorted in ascending or descending order
visually and with the aria-sort attribute. See the ARIA Authoring
Practices Guide's sortable table example for more information. Note: To

# <tt>: The Teletype Text element#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

The <tt> HTML element creates inline text which is presented using the
user agent's default monospace font face. This element was created for
the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed on a fixed-width
display such as a teletype, text-only screen, or line printer.

The terms non-proportional, monotype, and monospace are used
interchangeably and have the same general meaning: they describe a
typeface whose characters are all the same number of pixels wide.

This element is obsolete, however. You should use the more semantically
helpful <code>, <kbd>, <samp>, or <var> elements for inline text that
needs to be presented in monospace type, or the <pre> tag for content
that should be presented as a separate block.

Note: If none of the semantic elements are appropriate for your use case
(for example, if you need to show some content in a non-proportional
font), you should consider using the <span> element, styling it as
desired using CSS. The font-family property is a good place to start.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes

Examples

Basic example

This example uses <tt> to show text entered into, and output by, a
terminal application.

html

    <p>
      Enter the following at the telnet command prompt:
      <code>set localecho</code><br />

      The telnet client should display: <tt>Local Echo is on</tt>
    </p>

Result

Overriding the default font

You can override the browser's default font—if the browser permits you
to do so, which it isn't required to do—using CSS:

CSS

css

    tt {
      font-family: "Lucida Console", "Menlo", "Monaco", "Courier", monospace;
    }

HTML

html

    <p>
      Enter the following at the telnet command prompt:
      <code>set localecho</code><br />

      The telnet client should display: <tt>Local Echo is on</tt>
    </p>

Result

Usage notes

The <tt> element is, by default, rendered using the browser's default
non-proportional font. You can override this using CSS by creating a
rule using the tt selector, as seen in the example Overriding the
default font above.

Note: User-configured changes to the default monospace font setting may
take precedence over your CSS.

Although this element wasn't officially deprecated in HTML 4.01, its use
was discouraged in favor of the semantic elements and/or CSS. The <tt>
element is obsolete in HTML 5.

# <u>: The Unarticulated Annotation (Underline) element#

The <u> HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be
rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation.
This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be
altered using CSS.

Warning: This element used to be called the "Underline" element in older
versions of HTML, and is still sometimes misused in this way. To
underline text, you should instead apply a style that includes the CSS
text-decoration property set to underline.

Try it

HTML Demo: <u>

    p {
      margin: 0;
    }

    u {
      text-decoration: #f00 wavy underline;
    }

Output

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

See the Usage notes section for further details on when it's appropriate
to use <u> and when it isn't.

Attributes

This element only includes the global attributes.

Usage notes

Along with other pure styling elements, the original HTML Underline
(<u>) element was deprecated in HTML 4; however, <u> was restored in
HTML 5 with a new, semantic, meaning: to mark text as having some form
of non-textual annotation applied.

Note: Avoid using the <u> element with its default styling (of
underlined text) in such a way as to be confused with a hyperlink, which
is also underlined by default.

Use cases

Valid use cases for the <u> element include annotating spelling errors,
applying a proper name mark to denote proper names in Chinese text, and
other forms of annotation.

You should not use <u> to underline text for presentation purposes, or
to denote titles of books.

Other elements to consider using

In most cases, you should use an element other than <u>, such as:

-   <em> to denote stress emphasis
-   <b> to draw attention to text
-   <mark> to mark key words or phrases
-   <strong> to indicate that text has strong importance
-   <cite> to mark the titles of books or other publications
-   <i> to denote technical terms, transliterations, thoughts, or names
    of vessels in Western texts

To provide textual annotations (as opposed to the non-textual
annotations created with <u>), use the <ruby> element.

To apply an underlined appearance without any semantic meaning, use the
text-decoration property's value underline.

Examples

Indicating a spelling error

This example uses the <u> element and some CSS to display a paragraph
which includes a misspelled error, with the error indicated in the red
wavy underline style which is fairly commonly used for this purpose.

HTML

html

    <p>This paragraph includes a <u class="spelling">wrnogly</u> spelled word.</p>

In the HTML, we see the use of <u> with a class, spelling, which is used
to indicate the misspelling of the word "wrongly".

CSS

css

    u.spelling {
      text-decoration: red wavy underline;
    }

This CSS indicates that when the <u> element is styled with the class
spelling, it should have a red wavy underline underneath its text. This
is a common styling for spelling errors. Another common style can be
presented using red dashed underline.

Result

The result should be familiar to anyone who has used any of the more
popular word processors available today.

Avoiding <u>

Most of the time, you actually don't want to use <u>. Here are some
examples that show what you should do instead in several cases.

Non-semantic underlines

To underline text without implying any semantic meaning, use a <span>
element with the text-decoration property set to "underline", as shown
below.

HTML

html

    <span class="underline">Today's Special</span>
    <br />
    Chicken Noodle Soup With Carrots

CSS

css

    .underline {
      text-decoration: underline;
    }

Result

Presenting a book title

Book titles should be presented using the <cite> element instead of <u>
or even <i>.

Using the cite element

html

    <p>The class read <cite>Moby Dick</cite> in the first term.</p>

Styling the cite element

The default styling for the <cite> element renders the text in italics.
You can override that using CSS:

html

    <p>The class read <cite>Moby Dick</cite> in the first term.</p>

css

    cite {
      font-style: normal;
      text-decoration: underline;

Attributes

This element includes the global attributes.

compact Deprecated Non-standard

    This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a
    compact style. The interpretation of this attribute depends on the
    user agent, and it doesn't work in all browsers.

    Warning: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: use
    CSS instead. To give a similar effect as the compact attribute, the
    CSS property line-height can be used with a value of 80%.

type Deprecated Non-standard

    This attribute sets the bullet style for the list. The values
    defined under HTML3.2 and the transitional version of HTML 4.0/4.01
    are:

    -   circle
    -   disc
    -   square

    A fourth bullet type has been defined in the WebTV interface, but
    not all browsers support it: triangle.

    If not present and if no CSS list-style-type property applies to the
    element, the user agent selects a bullet type depending on the
    nesting level of the list.

    Warning: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated; use
    the CSS list-style-type property instead.

Usage notes

-   The <ul> element is for grouping a collection of items that do not
    have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is
    meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a
    bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a
    square. The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of
    the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type
    property.
-   The <ul> and <ol> elements may be nested as deeply as desired.
    Moreover, the nested lists may alternate between <ol> and <ul>
    without restriction.
-   The <ol> and <ul> elements both represent a list of items. They
    differ in that, with the <ol> element, the order is meaningful. To
    determine which one to use, try changing the order of the list
    items; if the meaning is changed, the <ol> element should be used,
    otherwise you can use <ul>.

Examples

Simple example

html

    <ul>
      <li>first item</li>
      <li>second item</li>
      <li>third item</li>

# <var>: The Variable element#

The <var> HTML element represents the name of a variable in a
mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically
presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although
that behavior is browser-dependent.

Related elements

Other elements that are used in contexts in which <var> is commonly used
include:

-   <code>: The HTML Code element
-   <kbd>: The HTML Keyboard input element
-   <samp>: The HTML Sample Output element

If you encounter code that is mistakenly using <var> for style purposes
rather than semantic purposes, you should either use a <span> with
appropriate CSS or, an appropriate semantic element among the following:

-   <em>
-   <i>
-   <q>

Default style

Most browsers apply font-style to "italic" when rendering <var>. This
can be overridden in CSS, like this:

css

    var {
      font-style: normal;
    }

Examples

Basic example

Overriding the default style

Using CSS, you can override the default style for the <var> element. In
this example, variable names are rendered using bold Courier if it's
available, otherwise it falls back to the default monospace font.

# <video>: The Video Embed element#

[] clear console

%html-content%

The above example shows simple usage of the <video> element. In a
similar manner to the <img> element, we include a path to the media we
want to display inside the src attribute; we can include other
attributes to specify information such as video width and height,
whether we want it to autoplay and loop, whether we want to show the
browser's default video controls, etc.

The content inside the opening and closing <video></video> tags is shown
as a fallback in browsers that don't support the element.

Attributes

Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global
attributes.

autoplay

    A Boolean attribute; if specified, the video automatically begins to
    play back as soon as it can do so without stopping to finish loading
    the data.

    Note: Sites that automatically play audio (or videos with an audio
    track) can be an unpleasant experience for users, so should be
    avoided when possible. If you must offer autoplay functionality, you
    should make it opt-in (requiring a user to specifically enable it).
    However, this can be useful when creating media elements whose
    source will be set at a later time, under user control. See our
    autoplay guide for additional information about how to properly use
    autoplay.

    To disable video autoplay, autoplay="false" will not work; the video
    will autoplay if the attribute is there in the <video> tag at all.
    To remove autoplay, the attribute needs to be removed altogether.

    In some browsers (e.g. Chrome 70.0) autoplay doesn't work if no
    muted attribute is present.

controls

    If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to
    allow the user to control video playback, including volume, seeking,
    and pause/resume playback.

controlslist

    The controlslist attribute, when specified, helps the browser select
    what controls to show for the video element whenever the browser
    shows its own set of controls (that is, when the controls attribute
    is specified).

    The allowed values are nodownload, nofullscreen and
    noremoteplayback.

    Use the disablepictureinpicture attribute if you want to disable the
    Picture-In-Picture mode (and the control).

crossorigin

    This enumerated attribute indicates whether to use CORS to fetch the
    related video. CORS-enabled resources can be reused in the <canvas>
    element without being tainted. The allowed values are:

    anonymous

        Sends a cross-origin request without a credential. In other
        words, it sends the Origin: HTTP header without a cookie, X.509
        certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the
        server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not
        setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: HTTP header), the
        resource will be tainted, and its usage restricted.

    use-credentials

        Sends a cross-origin request with a credential. In other words,
        it sends the Origin: HTTP header with a cookie, a certificate,
        or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not
        give credentials to the origin site (through
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: HTTP header), the resource
        will be tainted and its usage restricted.

    When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request
    (i.e. without sending the Origin: HTTP header), preventing its
    non-tainted use in <canvas> elements. If invalid, it is handled as
    if the enumerated keyword anonymous was used. See CORS settings
    attributes for additional information.

disablepictureinpicture

    Prevents the browser from suggesting a Picture-in-Picture context
    menu or to request Picture-in-Picture automatically in some cases.

disableremoteplayback

    A Boolean attribute used to disable the capability of remote
    playback in devices that are attached using wired (HDMI, DVI, etc.)
    and wireless technologies (Miracast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay,
    etc.).

    In Safari, you can use x-webkit-airplay="deny" as a fallback.

height

    The height of the video's display area, in CSS pixels (absolute
    values only; no percentages).

loop

    A Boolean attribute; if specified, the browser will automatically
    seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the video.

muted

    A Boolean attribute that indicates the default setting of the audio
    contained in the video. If set, the audio will be initially
    silenced. Its default value is false, meaning that the audio will be
    played when the video is played.

playsinline

    A Boolean attribute indicating that the video is to be played
    "inline", that is within the element's playback area. Note that the
    absence of this attribute does not imply that the video will always
    be played in fullscreen.

poster

    A URL for an image to be shown while the video is downloading. If
    this attribute isn't specified, nothing is displayed until the first
    frame is available, then the first frame is shown as the poster
    frame.

preload

    This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the
    browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user
    experience regarding what content is loaded before the video is
    played. It may have one of the following values:

    -   none: Indicates that the video should not be preloaded.
    -   metadata: Indicates that only video metadata (e.g. length) is
        fetched.
    -   auto: Indicates that the whole video file can be downloaded,
        even if the user is not expected to use it.
    -   empty string: Synonym of the auto value.

    The default value is different for each browser. The spec advises it
    to be set to metadata.

    Note:

    -   The autoplay attribute has precedence over preload. If autoplay
        is specified, the browser would obviously need to start
        downloading the video for playback.
    -   The specification does not force the browser to follow the value
        of this attribute; it is a mere hint.

src

    The URL of the video to embed. This is optional; you may instead use
    the <source> element within the video block to specify the video to
    embed.

width

Usage notes

Browsers don't all support the same video formats; you can provide
multiple sources inside nested <source> elements, and the browser will
then use the first one it understands.

html

    <video controls>
      <source src="myVideo.webm" type="video/webm" />
      <source src="myVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      <p>
        Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
        <a href="myVideo.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
      </p>
    </video>

We offer a substantive and thorough guide to media file types and the
guide to the codecs supported for video. Also available is a guide to
audio codecs that can be used with them.

Other usage notes:

-   If you don't specify the controls attribute, the video won't include
    the browser's default controls; you can create your own custom
    controls using JavaScript and the HTMLMediaElement API. See Creating
    a cross-browser video player for more details.
-   To allow precise control over your video (and audio) content,
    HTMLMediaElements fire many different events. In addition to
    providing controllability, these events let you monitor the progress
    of both download and playback of the media, as well as the playback
    state and position.
-   You can use the object-position property to adjust the positioning
    of the video within the element's frame, and the object-fit property
    to control how the video's size is adjusted to fit within the frame.
-   To show subtitles/captions along with your video, you can use some
    JavaScript along with the <track> element and the WebVTT format. See
    Adding captions and subtitles to HTML video for more information.
-   You can play audio files using a <video> element. This can be useful
    if, for example, you need to perform audio with a WebVTT transcript,
    since the <audio> element doesn't allow captions using WebVTT.
-   To test the fallback content on browsers that support the element,
    you can replace <video> with a non-existing element like
    <notavideo>.

A good general source of information on using HTML <video> is the Video
and audio content beginner's tutorial.

Styling with CSS

The <video> element is a replaced element — its display value is inline
by default, but its default width and height in the viewport is defined
by the video being embedded.

There are no special considerations for styling <video>; a common
strategy is to give it a display value of block to make it easier to
position, size, etc., and then provide styling and layout information as
required. Video player styling basics provides some useful styling
techniques.

Detecting track addition and removal

You can detect when tracks are added to and removed from a <video>
element using the addtrack and removetrack events. However, these events
aren't sent directly to the <video> element itself. Instead, they're
sent to the track list object within the <video> element's
HTMLMediaElement that corresponds to the type of track that was added to
the element:

HTMLMediaElement.audioTracks

    An AudioTrackList containing all of the media element's audio
    tracks. You can add a listener for addtrack to this object to be
    alerted when new audio tracks are added to the element.

HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks

    Add an addtrack listener to this VideoTrackList object to be
    informed when video tracks are added to the element.

HTMLMediaElement.textTracks

    Add an addtrack event listener to this TextTrackList to be notified
    when new text tracks are added to the element.

For example, to detect when audio tracks are added to or removed from a
<video> element, you can use code like this:

js

    const elem = document.querySelector("video");

    elem.audioTracks.onaddtrack = (event) => {
      trackEditor.addTrack(event.track);
    };

    elem.audioTracks.onremovetrack = (event) => {
      trackEditor.removeTrack(event.track);
    };

This code watches for audio tracks to be added to and removed from the
element, and calls a hypothetical function on a track editor to register
and remove the track from the editor's list of available tracks.

You can also use addEventListener() to listen for the addtrack and
removetrack events.

Server support for video

If the MIME type for the video is not set correctly on the server, the
video may not show or show a gray box containing an X (if JavaScript is
enabled).

If you use Apache Web Server to serve Ogg Theora videos, you can fix
this problem by adding the video file type extensions to "video/ogg"
MIME type. The most common video file type extensions are ".ogm",
".ogv", or ".ogg". To do this, edit the "mime.types" file in
"/etc/apache" or use the "AddType" configuration directive in
httpd.conf.

    AddType video/ogg .ogm
    AddType video/ogg .ogv
    AddType video/ogg .ogg

If you serve your videos as WebM, you can fix this problem for the
Apache Web Server by adding the extension used by your video files
(".webm" is the most common one) to the MIME type "video/webm" via the
"mime.types" file in "/etc/apache" or via the "AddType" configuration
directive in httpd.conf.

    AddType video/webm .webm

Your web host may provide an easy interface to MIME type configuration
changes for new technologies until a global update naturally occurs.

Examples

Single source

This example plays a video when activated, providing the user with the
browser's default video controls to control playback.

HTML

      Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can
      <a href="https://archive.org/details/BigBuckBunny_124">download it</a>

    </video>

Result

Until the video starts playing, the image provided in the poster
attribute is displayed in its place. If the browser doesn't support
video playback, the fallback text is displayed.

Multiple sources

This example builds on the last one, offering three different sources
for the media; this allows the video to be watched regardless of which
video codecs are supported by the browser.

html

    <!-- Using multiple sources as fallbacks for a video tag -->

      <source

        type="video/avi" />
      <source
        src="https://archive.org/download/ElephantsDream/ed_1024_512kb.mp4"
        type="video/mp4" />

      Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can
      <a href="https://archive.org/download/ElephantsDream/ed_1024_512kb.mp4">
        download the MP4
      </a>
      and watch it with your favorite video player!
    </video>

Result

First Ogg is tried. If that can't be played, then AVI is tried. Finally,
MP4 is tried. A fallback message is displayed if the video element isn't
supported, but not if all sources fail.

Some media file types let you provide more specific information using
the codecs parameter as part of the file's type string. A relatively
simple example is video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis", which says that the
file is a WebM video using VP8 for its video and Vorbis for audio.

Accessibility concerns

Videos should provide both captions and transcripts that accurately
describe its content (see Adding captions and subtitles to HTML video
for more information on how to implement these). Captions allow people
who are experiencing hearing loss to understand a video's audio content
as the video is being played, while transcripts allow people who need
additional time to be able to review audio content at a pace and format
that is comfortable for them.

It's worth noting that while you can caption audio-only media, you can
only do so when playing audio in a <video> element, since the video
region of the element is used to present the captions. This is one of
the special scenarios in which it's useful to play audio in a video
element.

If automatic captioning services are used, it is important to review the
generated content to ensure it accurately represents the source video.

In addition to spoken dialog, subtitles and transcripts should also
identify music and sound effects that communicate important information.
This includes emotion and tone:

    14
    00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
    [Dramatic rock music]

    15
    00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
    [whispering] What's that off in the distance?

    16
    00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
    It's… it's a…

    16 00:03:25 --> 00:03:32
    [Loud thumping]
    [Dishes clattering]

Captions should not obstruct the main subject of the video. They can be
positioned using the align VTT cue setting.

# <wbr>: The Line Break Opportunity element#

The <wbr> HTML element represents a word break opportunity—a position
within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its
line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.

Attributes

Notes

On UTF-8 encoded pages, <wbr> behaves like the U+200B ZERO-WIDTH SPACE
code point. In particular, it behaves like a Unicode bidi BN code point,
meaning it has no effect on bidi-ordering:
<div dir=rtl>123,<wbr>456</div> displays, when not broken on two lines,
123,456 and not 456,123.

For the same reason, the <wbr> element does not introduce a hyphen at
the line break point. To make a hyphen appear only at the end of a line,
use the soft hyphen character entity (&shy;) instead.

Examples

The Yahoo Style Guide recommends breaking a URL before punctuation, to
avoid leaving a punctuation mark at the end of the line, which the
reader might mistake for the end of the URL.

# <xmp>#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

Summary

The <xmp> HTML element renders text between the start and end tags
without interpreting the HTML in between and using a monospaced font.
The HTML2 specification recommended that it should be rendered wide
enough to allow 80 characters per line.

Note: Do not use this element.

-   It has been deprecated since HTML3.2 and was not implemented in a
    consistent way. It was completely removed from current HTML.
-   Use the <pre> element or, if semantically adequate, the <code>
    element instead. Note that you will need to escape the '<' character
    as '&lt;' and the '&' character as '&amp;' to make sure they are not
    interpreted as markup.
-   A monospaced font can also be obtained on any element, by applying
    an adequate CSS style using monospace as the generic-font value for
    the font-family property.

Attributes

This element has no other attributes than the global attributes, common
to all elements.

DOM interface

This element implements the HTMLElement interface.

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

Accessibility concerns

In addition to poor browser support, there are numerous concerns with
the accesskey attribute:

-   An accesskey value can conflict with a system or browser keyboard
    shortcut, or assistive technology functionality. What may work for
    one combination of operating system, assistive technology, and
    browser may not work with other combinations.
-   Certain accesskey values may not be present on certain keyboards,
    especially when internationalization is a concern. So adapting to
    specific languages could cause further problems.
-   accesskey values that rely on numbers may be confusing to
    individuals experiencing cognitive concerns, where the number
    doesn't have a logical association with the functionality it
    triggers.
-   Informing the user that accesskeys are present, so that they are
    aware of the functionality. If the system lacks a method of
    notifying the user about this feature, the user might accidentally
    activate accesskeys.

Because of these issues, it is generally advised not to use accesskeys
for most general-purpose websites and web apps.

# autocapitalize#

The autocapitalize global attribute is an enumerated attribute that
controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if so,
in what manner. This is relevant to:

-   <input> and <textarea> elements.
-   Any element with contenteditable set on it.

autocapitalize doesn't affect behavior when typing on a physical
keyboard. It affects the behavior of other input mechanisms such as
virtual keyboards on mobile devices and voice input. This can assist
users by making data entry quicker and easier, for example by
automatically capitalizing the first letter of each sentence.

Value

Possible values are:

none or off

    Do not automatically capitalize any text.

sentences or on

    Automatically capitalize the first character of each sentence.

words

    Automatically capitalize the first character of each word.

characters

    Automatically capitalize every character.

Usage notes

-   autocapitalize can be set on <input> and <textarea> elements, and on
    their containing <form> elements. When autocapitalize is set on a
    <form> element, it sets the autocapitalize behavior for all
    contained <input>s and <textarea>s, overriding any autocapitalize
    values set on contained elements.
-   autocapitalize has no effect on the url, email, or password <input>
    types, where autocapitalization is never enabled.
-   Where autocapitalize is not specified, the adopted default behavior
    varies between browsers. For example:
    -   Chrome and Safari default to on/sentences
    -   Firefox defaults to off/none.

Examples

HTML

html

    <p>Form to test different autocapitalize settings:</p>

    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="default">Default: no autocapitalize set</label>
        <input type="text" id="default" name="default" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="off">autocapitalize="off"</label>

    </p>

    div {
      margin-bottom: 20px;

# autofocus#

The autofocus global attribute is a Boolean attribute indicating that an
element should be focused on page load, or when the <dialog> that it is
part of is displayed.

html

    <input name="q" autofocus />

No more than one element in the document or dialog may have the
autofocus attribute. If applied to multiple elements the first one will
receive focus.

Note: The autofocus attribute applies to all elements, not just form
controls. For example, it might be used on a contenteditable area.

Accessibility concerns

Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired
people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive
impairments. When autofocus is assigned, screen-readers "teleport" their
user to the form control without warning them beforehand.

Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the autofocus
attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to
scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on
some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the
form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce
anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will
equally miss the context created by the preceding content.

%html-content%

Though the specification doesn't put requirements on the name of
classes, web developers are encouraged to use names that describe the
semantic purpose of the element, rather than the presentation of the
element. For example, attribute to describe an attribute rather than
italics, although an element of this class may be presented by italics.
Semantic names remain logical even if the presentation of the page
changes.

Output

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

The attribute must take one of the following values:

-   true or an empty string, which indicates that the element is
    editable.
-   false, which indicates that the element is not editable.
-   plaintext-only, which indicates that the element's raw text is
    editable, but rich text formatting is disabled.

If the attribute is given without a value, like
<label contenteditable>Example Label</label>, its value is treated as an
empty string.

If this attribute is missing or its value is invalid, its value is
inherited from its parent element: so the element is editable if its
parent is editable.

Note that although its allowed values include true and false, this
attribute is an enumerated one and not a Boolean one.

You can set the color used to draw the text insertion caret with the CSS
caret-color property.

Elements that are made editable, and therefore interactive, by using the
contenteditable attribute can be focused. They participate in sequential
keyboard navigation. However, elements with the contenteditable
attribute nested within other contenteditable elements are not added to
the tabbing sequence by default. You can add the nested contenteditable
elements to the keyboard navigation sequence by specifying the tabindex
value (tabindex="0").

# contextmenu#

Deprecated: This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers
might still support it, it may have already been removed from the
relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may
only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update
existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of
this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease
to work at any time.

Non-standard: This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards
track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not
work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between
implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

The contextmenu global attribute is the id of a <menu> to use as the
contextual menu for this element.

A context menu is a menu that appears upon user interaction, such as a
right-click. HTML now allows us to customize this menu. Here are some
implementation examples, including nested menus.

Example

HTML

html

    <body contextmenu="share">
      <menu type="context" id="share">
        <menu label="share">
          <menuitem label="Twitter" onclick="shareViaTwitter()"></menuitem>
          <menuitem label="Facebook" onclick="shareViaFacebook()"></menuitem>
        </menu>
      </menu>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Anywhere in the example you can share the page on Twitter and Facebook
          using the Share menu from your context menu.
        </li>
        <li contextmenu="changeFont" id="fontSizing">
          On this specific list element, you can change the size of the text by
          using the "Increase/Decrease font" actions from your context menu
        </li>
        <menu type="context" id="changeFont">
          <menuitem label="Increase Font" onclick="incFont()"></menuitem>
          <menuitem label="Decrease Font" onclick="decFont()"></menuitem>
        </menu>
        <li contextmenu="ChangeImage" id="changeImage">
          On the image below, you can fire the "Change Image" action in your Context
          Menu.<br />
          <img
            src="promobutton_mdn5.png"
            contextmenu="ChangeImage"

%html-content%

All such custom data are available via the HTMLElement interface of the
element the attribute is set on. The HTMLElement.dataset property gives
access to them. The * may be replaced by any name following the
production rule of XML names which includes the following
recommendations:

-   The name should not start with xml (case-insensitive), as it's
    reserved for future XML specifications.
-   The name should not contain any colon characters (:), as XML assigns
    meaning to such names.
-   The name should not contain any capital letters, as XML is all
    lowercase.

These are recommendations. If these naming recommendations are not
followed, no errors will occur. The attributes will still be matched
using CSS attribute selectors, with the attribute being case insensitive
and any attribute value being case-sensitive. Attributes not conforming
to these three recommendations will also still be recognized by the
JavaScript HTMLElement.dataset property and user-agents will include the
attribute in the DOMStringMap containing all the custom data attributes
for an HTMLElement.

If you plan to use HTMLElement.dataset, the portion of the attribute
name following the data- can only include characters allowed in
JavaScript property names (and hyphens, which will be removed). The
dataset version of the attribute name removes the "data-" prefix and
converts the rest of the name from kebab-case to camelCase. For example,
element.getAttribute("data-test") is equivalent to element.dataset.test
and data-test-abc will be accessible as HTMLElement.dataset.testAbc (or
by HTMLElement.dataset["testAbc"]). Avoid non-alphabetic characters
following a hyphen, such as data-test-1 or data--test, as they will not
be recognized by HTMLElement.dataset.

Usage

By adding data-* attributes, even ordinary HTML elements can become
rather complex and powerful program-objects. For example, a space-ship
"sprite" in a game could be a simple <img> element with a class
attribute and several data-* attributes:

html

    <img
      class="spaceship cruiserX3"
      src="shipX3.png"
      data-ship-id="324"
      data-weapons="laserI laserII"
      data-shields="72%"
      data-x="414354"
      data-y="85160"
      data-z="31940"
      onclick="spaceships[this.dataset.shipId].blasted()" />

data attributes.

It can have the following values:

-   ltr, which means left to right and is to be used for languages that
    are written from the left to the right (like English);
-   rtl, which means right to left and is to be used for languages that
    are written from the right to the left (like Arabic);
-   auto, which lets the user agent decide. It uses a basic algorithm as
    it parses the characters inside the element until it finds a
    character with a strong directionality, then applies that
    directionality to the whole element.

Note: This attribute is mandatory for the <bdo> element where it has a
different semantic meaning.

-   This attribute is not inherited by the <bdi> element. If not set,
    its value is auto.
-   This attribute can be overridden by the CSS properties direction and
    unicode-bidi, if a CSS page is active and the element supports these
    properties.
-   As the directionality of the text is semantically related to its
    content and not to its presentation, it is recommended that web
    developers use this attribute instead of the related CSS properties
    when possible. That way, the text will display correctly even on a
    browser that doesn't support CSS or has the CSS deactivated.
-   The auto value should be used for data with an unknown
    directionality, like data coming from user input, eventually stored
    in a database.

Note: Browsers might allow users to change the directionality of <input>
and <textarea>s in order to assist with authoring content. Chrome and
Safari provide a directionality option in the contextual menu of input
fields while Legacy Edge uses the key combinations Ctrl + Left Shift and
Ctrl + Right Shift. Firefox uses Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + X but does NOT
update the dir attribute value.

# draggable#

The draggable global attribute is an enumerated attribute that indicates
whether the element can be dragged, either with native browser behavior
or the HTML Drag and Drop API.

The draggable attribute may be applied to elements that strictly fall
under the HTML namespace, which means that it cannot be applied to SVGs.
For more information about what namespace declarations look like, and
what they do, see Namespace crash course.

draggable can have the following values:

-   true: the element can be dragged.
-   false: the element cannot be dragged.

Warning: This attribute is enumerated and not Boolean. A value of true
or false is mandatory, and shorthand like <img draggable> is forbidden.
The correct usage is <img draggable="false">.

If this attribute is not set, its default value is auto, which means
drag behavior is the default browser behavior: only text selections,
images, and links can be dragged. For other elements, the event
ondragstart must be set for drag and drop to work, as shown in this
comprehensive example.

%html-content%

Description

Form controls (such as <textarea> or <input> elements) or elements using
contenteditable can specify an inputmode attribute to control what kind
of virtual keyboard will be used. To further improve the user's
experience, the enter key can be customized specifically by providing an
enterkeyhint attribute indicating how the enter key should be labeled
(or which icon should be shown). The enter key usually represents what
the user should do next; typical actions are: sending text, inserting a
new line, or searching.

If no enterkeyhint attribute is provided, the user agent might use
contextual information from the inputmode, type, or pattern attributes
to display a suitable enter key label (or icon).

Values

The enterkeyhint attribute is an enumerated attribute and only accepts
the following values:

  Value                     Description                                                                                          Example label (depends on user agent and user language)
  ------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  enterkeyhint="enter"      Typically inserting a new line.                                                                      ↵
  enterkeyhint="done"       Typically meaning there is nothing more to input and the input method editor (IME) will be closed.   Done
  enterkeyhint="go"         Typically meaning to take the user to the target of the text they typed.                             Open
  enterkeyhint="next"       Typically taking the user to the next field that will accept text.                                   Next
  enterkeyhint="previous"   Typically taking the user to the previous field that will accept text.                               Previous
  enterkeyhint="search"     Typically taking the user to the results of searching for the text they have typed.                  Search
  enterkeyhint="send"       Typically delivering the text to its target.                                                         Send

# exportparts#

The exportparts global attribute allows you to select and style elements
existing in nested shadow trees, by exporting their part names.

The shadow tree is an isolated structure where identifiers, classes, and
styles cannot be reached by selectors or queries belonging to a regular
DOM. There are two HTML attributes that can be applied to shadow tree
elements that enable targeting CSS styles from outside to shadow tree:
part and exportparts.

The global part attribute makes a shadow tree element visible to its
parent DOM. A part name is used as the parameter of the ::part()
pseudo-element. In this way, you can apply CSS styles to elements in the
shadow tree from outside of it. However, the ::part() pseudo-element is
only visible to the parent DOM. This means that when a shadow tree is
nested, the parts are not visible to any ancestors other than the direct
parent. The exportparts attribute solves this limitation.

The exportparts attribute enables shadow tree parts to be visible
outside the shadow DOM. This concept is referred to as "exporting". The
exportparts attribute is placed on the element's shadow host, which is
the element to which the shadow tree is attached. The value of this
attribute is a comma-separated list of part names present in the shadow
tree. These names are made available to the DOMs outside the current
structure.

html

    <template id="ancestor-component">
      <nested-component exportparts="part1, part2, part5"></nested-component>
    </template>

When exporting a part, you have the option to assign a different name to
the part, as shown in the snippet below. The value of the exportparts
attribute is really a comma-separated list of part-name mappings. So the
exportparts attribute in the above code snippet is the equivalent of
exportparts="part1:part1, part2:part2, part5:part5, indicating that each
part is exported with the same name. In each mapping, the first string
specifies the name of the part within the shadow tree, and the second
string specifies the name with which the part will be exposed
externally.

html

    <template id="ancestor-component">
      <nested-component
        exportparts="part1:exposed1, part2:exposed2"></nested-component>

# hidden#

The hidden global attribute is an enumerated attribute indicating that
the browser should not render the contents of the element. For example,
it can be used to hide elements of the page that can't be used until the
login process has been completed.

      padding: 5px;
      border-radius: 5px;
    }

Output

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

Description

The hidden attribute is used to indicate that the content of an element
should not be presented to the user. This attribute can take any one of
the following values:

-   an empty string
-   the keyword hidden
-   the keyword until-found

There are two states associated with the hidden attribute: the hidden
state and the hidden until found state.

-   An empty string, or the keyword hidden, set the element to the
    hidden state. Additionally, invalid values set the element to the
    hidden state.
-   The keyword until-found sets the element to the hidden until found
    state.

Thus, all the following set the element to the hidden state:

html

    <span hidden>I'm hidden</span>
    <span hidden="">I'm also hidden</span>
    <span hidden="hidden">I'm hidden too!</span>

The following sets the element to the hidden until found state:

html

    <span hidden="until-found">I'm hidden until found</span>

The hidden attribute must not be used to hide content just from one
presentation. If something is marked hidden, it is hidden from all
presentations, including, for instance, screen readers.

Hidden elements shouldn't be linked from non-hidden elements. For
example, it would be incorrect to use the href attribute to link to a
section marked with the hidden attribute. If the content is not
applicable or relevant, then there is no reason to link to it.

It would be fine, however, to use the ARIA aria-describedby attribute to
refer to descriptions that are themselves hidden. While hiding the
descriptions implies that they are not useful on their own, they could
be written in such a way that they are useful in the specific context of
being referenced from the element that they describe.

Similarly, a canvas element with the hidden attribute could be used by a
scripted graphics engine as an off-screen buffer, and a form control
could refer to a hidden form element using its form attribute.

Elements that are descendants of a hidden element are still active,
which means that script elements can still execute and form elements can
still submit.

The hidden state

The hidden state indicates that the element is not currently relevant to
the page, or that it is being used to declare content for reuse by other
parts of the page and should not be directly presented to the user. The
browser will not render elements that are in the hidden state.

Web browsers may implement the hidden state using display: none, in
which case the element will not participate in page layout. This also
means that changing the value of the CSS display property on an element
in the hidden state will override the state. For instance, elements
styled display: block will be displayed despite the hidden attribute's
presence.

The hidden until found state

In the hidden until found state, the element is hidden but its content
will be accessible to the browser's "find in page" feature or to
fragment navigation. When these features cause a scroll to an element in
a hidden until found subtree, the browser will:

-   fire a beforematch event on the hidden element
-   remove the hidden attribute from the element
-   scroll to the element

This enables a developer to collapse a section of content, but make it
searchable and accessible via fragment navigation.

Note that browsers typically implement hidden until found using
content-visibility: hidden. This means that unlike elements in the
hidden state, elements in the hidden until found state will have
generated boxes, meaning that:

-   the element will participate in page layout
-   margin, borders, padding, and background for the element will be
    rendered.

Also, the element needs to be affected by layout containment in order to
be revealed. This means that if the element in the hidden until found
state has a display value of none, contents, or inline, then the element
will not be revealed by find in page or fragment navigation.

Examples

Using until-found

In this example we have:

-   Three <div> elements. The first and the third are not hidden, while
    the second has hidden="until-found"and id="until-found-box"
    attributes.
-   A link whose target is the "until-found-box" fragment.

The hidden until found element has a dotted red border and a gray
background.

We also have some JavaScript that listens for the beforematch event
firing on the hidden until found element. The event handler changes the
text content of the box.

HTML

html

    <a href="#until-found-box">Go to hidden content</a>

    <div>I'm not hidden</div>
    <div id="until-found-box" hidden="until-found">Hidden until found</div>
    <div>I'm not hidden</div>

    <button id="reset">Reset</button>

CSS

css

    div {
      height: 40px;
      width: 300px;
      border: 5px dashed black;
      margin: 1rem 0;
      padding: 1rem;
      font-size: 2rem;
    }

    div#until-found-box {
      color: red;
      border: 5px dotted red;
      background-color: lightgray;
    }

    #until-found-box {
      scroll-margin-top: 200px;
    }

JavaScript

js

    const untilFound = document.querySelector("#until-found-box");
    untilFound.addEventListener(
      "beforematch",
      () => (untilFound.textContent = "I've been revealed!"),
    );

    document.querySelector("#reset").addEventListener("click", () => {
      document.location.hash = "";
      document.location.reload();
    });

Result

Note that although the content of the element is hidden, the element
still has a generated box, occupying space in the layout and with
background and borders rendered.

Clicking the "Go to hidden content" button navigates to the hidden until
found element. The beforematch event fires, the text content is updated,
and the element content is displayed.

To run the example again, click "Reset".

# Global attributes#

Global attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements; they can
be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some
elements.

Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not
specified in the standard. That means that any non-standard elements
must still permit these attributes, even though using those elements
means that the document is no longer HTML5-compliant. For example,
HTML5-compliant browsers hide content marked as <foo hidden>…</foo>,
even though <foo> is not a valid HTML element.

In addition to the basic HTML global attributes, the following global
attributes also exist:

-   xml:lang and xml:base — these are inherited from the XHTML
    specifications and deprecated, but kept for compatibility purposes.
-   The ARIA role attribute and the multiple aria-* states and
    properties, used for ensuring accessibility.
-   The event handler attributes: onabort, onautocomplete,
    onautocompleteerror, onblur, oncancel, oncanplay, oncanplaythrough,
    onchange, onclick, onclose, oncontextmenu, oncuechange, ondblclick,
    ondrag, ondragend, ondragenter, ondragleave, ondragover,
    ondragstart, ondrop, ondurationchange, onemptied, onended, onerror,
    onfocus, oninput, oninvalid, onkeydown, onkeypress, onkeyup, onload,
    onloadeddata, onloadedmetadata, onloadstart, onmousedown,
    onmouseenter, onmouseleave, onmousemove, onmouseout, onmouseover,
    onmouseup, onmousewheel, onpause, onplay, onplaying, onprogress,
    onratechange, onreset, onresize, onscroll, onseeked, onseeking,
    onselect, onshow, onsort, onstalled, onsubmit, onsuspend,
    ontimeupdate, ontoggle, onvolumechange, onwaiting.

List of global attributes

accesskey

    Provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the current
    element. This attribute consists of a space-separated list of
    characters. The browser should use the first one that exists on the
    computer keyboard layout.

autocapitalize

    Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized and, if
    so, in what manner.

autofocus

    Indicates that an element is to be focused on page load, or as soon
    as the <dialog> it is part of is displayed. This attribute is a
    boolean, initially false.

class

    A space-separated list of the classes of the element. Classes allow
    CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements via the
    class selectors or functions like the method
    Document.getElementsByClassName().

contenteditable

    An enumerated attribute indicating if the element should be editable
    by the user. If so, the browser modifies its widget to allow
    editing. The attribute must take one of the following values:

    -   true or the empty string, which indicates that the element must
        be editable;
    -   false, which indicates that the element must not be editable.

contextmenu Deprecated Non-standard

    The id of a <menu> to use as the contextual menu for this element.

data-*

    Forms a class of attributes, called custom data attributes, that
    allow proprietary information to be exchanged between the HTML and
    its DOM representation that may be used by scripts. All such custom
    data are available via the HTMLElement interface of the element the
    attribute is set on. The HTMLElement.dataset property gives access
    to them.

dir

    An enumerated attribute indicating the directionality of the
    element's text. It can have the following values:

    -   ltr, which means left to right and is to be used for languages
        that are written from the left to the right (like English);
    -   rtl, which means right to left and is to be used for languages
        that are written from the right to the left (like Arabic);
    -   auto, which lets the user agent decide. It uses a basic
        algorithm as it parses the characters inside the element until
        it finds a character with a strong directionality, then it
        applies that directionality to the whole element.

draggable

    An enumerated attribute indicating whether the element can be
    dragged, using the Drag and Drop API. It can have the following
    values:

    -   true, which indicates that the element may be dragged
    -   false, which indicates that the element may not be dragged.

enterkeyhint

    Hints what action label (or icon) to present for the enter key on
    virtual keyboards.

exportparts

    Used to transitively export shadow parts from a nested shadow tree
    into a containing light tree.

hidden

    An enumerated attribute indicating that the element is not yet, or
    is no longer, relevant. For example, it can be used to hide elements
    of the page that can't be used until the login process has been
    completed. The browser won't render such elements. This attribute
    must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be shown.

id

    Defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole
    document. Its purpose is to identify the element when linking (using
    a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS).

inert

    A boolean value that makes the browser disregard user input events
    for the element. Useful when click events are present.

inputmode

    Provides a hint to browsers about the type of virtual keyboard
    configuration to use when editing this element or its contents. Used
    primarily on <input> elements, but is usable on any element while in
    contenteditable mode.

is

    Allows you to specify that a standard HTML element should behave
    like a registered custom built-in element (see Using custom elements
    for more details).

Note: The item* attributes are part of the WHATWG HTML Microdata
feature.

itemid

    The unique, global identifier of an item.

itemprop

    Used to add properties to an item. Every HTML element may have an
    itemprop attribute specified, where an itemprop consists of a name
    and value pair.

itemref

    Properties that are not descendants of an element with the itemscope
    attribute can be associated with the item using an itemref. It
    provides a list of element ids (not itemids) with additional
    properties elsewhere in the document.

itemscope

    itemscope (usually) works along with itemtype to specify that the
    HTML contained in a block is about a particular item. itemscope
    creates the Item and defines the scope of the itemtype associated
    with it. itemtype is a valid URL of a vocabulary (such as
    schema.org) that describes the item and its properties context.

itemtype

    Specifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to define
    itemprops (item properties) in the data structure. itemscope is used
    to set the scope of where in the data structure the vocabulary set
    by itemtype will be active.

lang

    Helps define the language of an element: the language that
    non-editable elements are in, or the language that editable elements
    should be written in by the user. The attribute contains one
    "language tag" (made of hyphen-separated "language subtags") in the
    format defined in RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages (also
    known as BCP 47). xml:lang has priority over it.

nonce

    A cryptographic nonce ("number used once") which can be used by
    Content Security Policy to determine whether or not a given fetch
    will be allowed to proceed.

part

    A space-separated list of the part names of the element. Part names
    allows CSS to select and style specific elements in a shadow tree
    via the ::part pseudo-element.

popover

    Used to designate an element as a popover element (see Popover API).
    Popover elements are hidden via display: none until opened via an
    invoking/control element (i.e. a <button> or <input type="button">
    with a popovertarget attribute) or a HTMLElement.showPopover() call.

role

    Roles define the semantic meaning of content, allowing screen
    readers and other tools to present and support interaction with an
    object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that
    type of object. roles are added to HTML elements using
    role="role_type", where role_type is the name of a role in the ARIA
    specification.

slot

    Assigns a slot in a shadow DOM shadow tree to an element: An element
    with a slot attribute is assigned to the slot created by the <slot>
    element whose name attribute's value matches that slot attribute's
    value.

spellcheck

    An enumerated attribute defines whether the element may be checked
    for spelling errors. It may have the following values:

    -   empty string or true, which indicates that the element should
        be, if possible, checked for spelling errors;
    -   false, which indicates that the element should not be checked
        for spelling errors.

style

    Contains CSS styling declarations to be applied to the element. Note
    that it is recommended for styles to be defined in a separate file
    or files. This attribute and the <style> element have mainly the
    purpose of allowing for quick styling, for example for testing
    purposes.

tabindex

    An integer attribute indicating if the element can take input focus
    (is focusable), if it should participate to sequential keyboard
    navigation, and if so, at what position. It can take several values:

    -   a negative value means that the element should be focusable, but
        should not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation;
    -   0 means that the element should be focusable and reachable via
        sequential keyboard navigation, but its relative order is
        defined by the platform convention;
    -   a positive value means that the element should be focusable and
        reachable via sequential keyboard navigation; the order in which
        the elements are focused is the increasing value of the
        tabindex. If several elements share the same tabindex, their
        relative order follows their relative positions in the document.

title

    Contains a text representing advisory information related to the
    element it belongs to. Such information can typically, but not
    necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip.

translate

    An enumerated attribute that is used to specify whether an element's
    attribute values and the values of its Text node children are to be
    translated when the page is localized, or whether to leave them
    unchanged. It can have the following values:

    -   empty string or yes, which indicates that the element will be
        translated.
    -   no, which indicates that the element will not be translated.

virtualkeyboardpolicy Experimental

    An enumerated attribute used to control the on-screen virtual
    keyboard behavior on devices such as tablets, mobile phones, or
    other devices where a hardware keyboard may not be available for
    elements that its content is editable (for example, it is an <input>
    or <textarea> element, or an element with the contenteditable
    attribute set).

    -   auto or an empty string, which automatically shows the virtual
        keyboard when the element is focused or tapped.
    -   manual, which decouples focus and tap on the element from the
        virtual keyboard's state.

# id#

The id global attribute defines an identifier (ID) which must be unique
in the whole document. Its purpose is to identify the element when
linking (using a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (with CSS).

Warning: This attribute's value is an opaque string: this means that web
authors should not rely on it to convey human-readable information
(although having your IDs somewhat human-readable can be useful for code
comprehension, e.g. consider ticket-18659 versus r45tgfe-freds&$@).

An id's value must not contain whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.). Browsers
treat non-conforming IDs that contain whitespace as if the whitespace is
part of the ID. In contrast to the class attribute, which allows
space-separated values, elements can only have one single ID value.

Technically, the value for an id attribute may contain any character,
except whitespace characters. However, to avoid inadvertent errors, only
ASCII letters, digits, '_', and '-' should be used, and the value for an
id attribute should start with a letter.

For example, . has a special meaning in CSS (it starts a class
selector). While valid, unless you are careful to escape it when used as
part of a CSS selector, it won't be recognized as part of the element's
id. The same applies to the querySelector() and querySelectorAll()
parameters, which use the same selector syntax. It is easy to forget to
do this, resulting in bugs in your code that could be hard to detect.

Similarly, an id starting with a digit (E.g., 1234-322-678) or a hyphen
followed by a digit (E.g., -123), though valid in HTML, may lead to
problems when used in CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs:

-   CSS ID selectors accept any CSS identifier. If the id starts with a
    digit or one hyphen immediately followed by a digit, both the hyphen
    and digit must be escaped in CSS. For example, while
    id="544-383-3388" and id="-3Pi" are valid in HTML, the id selectors
    must be escaped. The element with these id values can be targeted in
    CSS with #\35 44-383-3388 and #\2D \33 pi.
-   Any valid HTML id value is valid as an attribute selector in CSS and
    JavaScript. The selectors [id="544-383-3388"] and [id="-3Pi"] are
    valid.
-   Document.querySelector() and similar methods using
    CSS-selector-style queries will not find them unless you escape
    them. (See this page for an example.)
-   Such an id is not a valid JavaScript identifier. Elements with IDs
    become global properties, but you cannot use non-identifier global
    properties as global variables — 1234 is not a global variable, and
    you have to use window[1234] instead to get the element with
    id="1234". This is slightly inconvenient as you have to create the
    variable with an extra step: const element = window[1234].

# inert#

The inert global attribute is a Boolean attribute indicating that the
browser will ignore the element. With the inert attribute, all of the
element's flat tree descendants (such as modal <dialog>s) that don't
otherwise escape inertness are ignored. The inert attribute also makes
the browser ignore input events sent by the user, including
focus-related events and events from assistive technologies.

Specifically, inert does the following:

-   Prevents the click event from being fired when the user clicks on
    the element.
-   Prevents the focus event from being raised by preventing the element
    from gaining focus.
-   Hides the element and its content from assistive technologies by
    excluding them from the accessibility tree.

html

    <body inert>
      <!-- content -->
    </body>

The inert attribute can be added to sections of content that should not
be interactive. When an element is inert, it along with all of the
element's descendants, including normally interactive elements such as
links, buttons, and form controls are disabled because they cannot
receive focus or be clicked.

The inert attribute can also be added to elements that should be
offscreen or hidden. An inert element, along with its descendants, gets
removed from the tab order and accessibility tree.

Note: While inert is a global attribute and can be applied to any
element, it is generally used for sections of content. To make
individual controls "inert", consider using the disabled attribute,
along with CSS :disabled styles, instead.

Accessibility concerns

Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the inert
attribute. By default, there is no visual way to tell whether or not an
element or its subtree is inert. As a web developer, it is your
responsibility to clearly indicate the content parts that are active and
those that are inert.

While providing visual and non-visual cues about content inertness, also
remember that the visual viewport may contain only sections of content.
Users may be zoomed in to a small section of content, or users may not
be able to view the content at all. Inert sections not being obviously
inert can lead to frustration and bad user experience.

# inputmode#

The inputmode global attribute is an enumerated attribute that hints at
the type of data that might be entered by the user while editing the
element or its contents. This allows a browser to display an appropriate
virtual keyboard.

It is used primarily on <input> elements, but is usable on any element
in contenteditable mode.

It's important to understand that the inputmode attribute doesn't cause
any validity requirements to be enforced on input. To require that input
conforms to a particular data type, choose an appropriate
<input> element type. For specific guidance on choosing <input> types,
see the Values section.

Values

The attribute can have any of the following values:

none

    No virtual keyboard. For when the page implements its own keyboard
    input control.

text (default value)

    Standard input keyboard for the user's current locale.

decimal

    Fractional numeric input keyboard containing the digits and decimal
    separator for the user's locale (typically . or ,). Devices may or
    may not show a minus key (-).

numeric

    Numeric input keyboard, but only requires the digits 0–9. Devices
    may or may not show a minus key.

tel

    A telephone keypad input, including the digits 0–9, the asterisk
    (*), and the pound (#) key. Inputs that *require* a telephone number
    should typically use <input type="tel"> instead.

search

    A virtual keyboard optimized for search input. For instance, the
    return/submit key may be labeled "Search", along with possible other
    optimizations. Inputs that require a search query should typically
    use <input type="search"> instead.

email

    A virtual keyboard optimized for entering email addresses. Typically
    includes the @character as well as other optimizations. Inputs that
    require email addresses should typically use <input type="email">
    instead.

url

    A keypad optimized for entering URLs. This may have the / key more
    prominent, for example. Enhanced features could include history
    access and so on. Inputs that require a URL should typically use
    <input type="url"> instead.

# is#

The is global attribute allows you to specify that a standard HTML
element should behave like a defined custom built-in element (see Using
custom elements for more details).

This attribute can only be used if the specified custom element name has
been successfully defined in the current document, and extends the
element type it is being applied to.

Examples

The following code is taken from our word-count-web-component example
(see it live also).

js

    // Create a class for the element
    class WordCount extends HTMLParagraphElement {
      constructor() {
        // Always call super first in constructor
        super();

        // Constructor contents omitted for brevity
        // …
      }
    }

    // Define the new element
    customElements.define("word-count", WordCount, { extends: "p" });

html

    <p is="word-count"></p>

# itemid#

The itemid global attribute provides microdata in the form of a unique,
global identifier of an item.

An itemid attribute can only be specified for an element that has both
itemscope and itemtype attributes. Also, itemid can only be specified on
elements that possess an itemscope attribute whose corresponding
itemtype refers to or defines a vocabulary that supports global
identifiers.

The exact meaning of an itemtype's global identifier is provided by the
definition of that identifier within the specified vocabulary. The
vocabulary defines whether several items with the same global identifier
can coexist and, if so, how items with the same identifier are handled.

Note: The WHATWG definition specifies that an itemid must be a URL.
However, the following example correctly illustrates that a URN may also
be used. This inconsistency may reflect the incomplete nature of the
Microdata specification.

Examples

Representing structured data for a book

This example uses microdata attributes to represent the following
structured data:

  ----------- ------------------ ------------------------------------------------- -------------------------
  itemscope   itemtype: itemid   https://schema.org/Book: urn:isbn:0-374-22848-5

# itemprop#

The itemprop global attribute is used to add properties to an item.
Every HTML element can have an itemprop attribute specified, and an
itemprop consists of a name-value pair. Each name-value pair is called a
property, and a group of one or more properties forms an item. Property
values are either a string or a URL and can be associated with a very
wide range of elements including <audio>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>,
<link>, <object>, <source>, <track>, and <video>.

Examples

The example below shows the source for a set of elements marked up with
itemprop attributes, followed by a table showing the resulting
structured data.

HTML

html

    <div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Movie">
      <h1 itemprop="name">Avatar</h1>
      <span>
        Director:
        <span itemprop="director">James Cameron</span>
        (born August 16, 1954)
      </span>
      <span itemprop="genre">Science fiction</span>
      <a href="../movies/avatar-theatrical-trailer.html" itemprop="trailer">
        Trailer
      </a>
    </div>

Structured data

  ---------- --------------- ------------------------------------------
             Item            
             itemprop name   itemprop value
  itemprop   name            Avatar
  itemprop   director        James Cameron
  itemprop   genre           Science fiction
  itemprop   trailer         ../movies/avatar-theatrical-trailer.html
  ---------- --------------- ------------------------------------------

Properties

Properties have values that are either a string or a URL. When a string
value is a URL, it is expressed using the <a> element and its href
attribute, the <img> element and its src attribute, or other elements
that link to or embed external resources.

Three properties with values that are strings

html

    <div itemscope>
      <p>My name is <span itemprop="name">Neil</span>.</p>
      <p>My band is called <span itemprop="band">Four Parts Water</span>.</p>
      <p>I am <span itemprop="nationality">British</span>.</p>
    </div>

One property, "image", whose value is a URL

html

    <div itemscope>
      <img itemprop="image" src="google-logo.png" alt="Google" />
    </div>

When a string value can't be easily read and understood by a person
(e.g., a long string of numbers and letters), it can be displayed using
the value attribute of the data element, with the more
easily-understood-by-a human-version given in the element's contents
(which is not part of the structured data - see example below).

An item with a property whose value is a product ID

The ID is not human-friendly, so the product's name is used instead.

html

    <h1 itemscope>
      <data itemprop="product-id" value="9678AOU879">The Instigator 2000</data>
    </h1>

For numeric data, the meter element and its value attribute can be used.

A meter element

html

    <div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Product">
      <span itemprop="name">Panasonic White 60L Refrigerator</span>
      <img src="panasonic-fridge-60l-white.jpg" alt="" />
      <div
        itemprop="aggregateRating"
        itemscope
        itemtype="http://schema.org/AggregateRating">
        <meter itemprop="ratingValue" min="0" value="3.5" max="5">
          Rated 3.5/5
        </meter>
        (based on <span itemprop="reviewCount">11</span>
        customer reviews)
      </div>
    </div>

Similarly, for date- and time-related data, the time element and its
datetime attribute can be used.

An item with one property, "birthday", whose value is a date

html

    <div itemscope>
      I was born on
      <time itemprop="birthday" datetime="1984-05-10">May 10th 1984</time>.
    </div>

Properties can also be groups of name-value pairs, by putting the
itemscope attribute on the element that declares the property. Each
value is either a string or a group of name-value pairs (i.e. an item).

An outer item representing a person, and an inner one representing a band

html

    <div itemscope>
      <p>Name: <span itemprop="name">Amanda</span></p>
      <p>
        Band:
        <span itemprop="band" itemscope>
          <span itemprop="name">Jazz Band</span>
          (<span itemprop="size">12</span> players)
        </span>
      </p>
    </div>

The outer item above has two properties, "name" and "band". The "name"
is "Amanda", and the "band" is an item in its own right, with two
properties, "name" and "size". The "name" of the band is "Jazz Band",
and the "size" is "12". The outer item in this example is a top-level
microdata item. Items that are not part of others are called top-level
microdata items.

All the properties separated from their items

This example is the same as the previous one, but all the properties are
separated from their items.

html

    <div itemscope id="amanda" itemref="a b"></div>
    <p id="a">Name: <span itemprop="name">Amanda</span></p>
    <div id="b" itemprop="band" itemscope itemref="c"></div>
    <div id="c">
      <p>Band: <span itemprop="name">Jazz Band</span></p>
      <p>Size: <span itemprop="size">12</span> players</p>
    </div>

This gives the same result as the previous example. The first item has
two properties, "name", set to "Amanda", and "band", set to another
item. That second item has two further properties, "name", set to "Jazz
Band", and "size", set to "12".

An item can have multiple properties with the same name and different
values.

Ice cream with two flavors

html

    <div itemscope>
      <p>Flavors in my favorite ice cream:</p>
      <ul>
        <li itemprop="flavor">Lemon sorbet</li>
        <li itemprop="flavor">Apricot sorbet</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

This results in an item with two properties, both with the name "flavor"
and having the values "Lemon sorbet" and "Apricot sorbet".

An element introducing a property can also introduce multiple properties
at once, to avoid duplication when some of the properties have the same
value.

An item with two properties, "favorite-color" and "favorite-fruit", both set to the value "orange"

html

    <div itemscope>
      <span
        itemprop="favorite-color
        favorite-fruit"
        >orange
      </span>
    </div>

Note: There is no relationship between the microdata and the content of
the document where the microdata is marked up.

Same structured data marked up in two different ways

There is no semantic difference between the following two examples

html

    <figure>
      <img src="castle.jpeg" />
      <figcaption>
        <span itemscope><span itemprop="name">The Castle</span></span> (1986)
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

html

    <span itemscope><meta itemprop="name" content="The Castle" /></span>
    <figure>
      <img src="castle.jpeg" />
      <figcaption>The Castle (1986)</figcaption>
    </figure>

Both have a figure with a caption, and both, completely unrelated to the
figure, have an item with a name-value pair with the name "name" and the
value "The Castle". The only difference is that if the user drags the
figcaption out of the document, the item will be included in the
drag-and-drop data. The image associated with the item won't be
included.

Names and values

A property is an unordered set of unique tokens that are case-sensitive
and represent the name-value pairs. The property value must have at
least one token. In the example below, each data cell is a token.

Names examples

             Item                                                  
  ---------- ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
             itemprop name                                         itemprop value
  itemprop   country                                               Ireland
  itemprop   Option                                                2
  itemprop   https://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6992065114/   Ring of Kerry
  itemprop   img                                                   https://www.flickr.com/photos/nlireland/6992065114/
  itemprop   website                                               flickr
  itemprop   (token)                                               (token)

Tokens are either strings or URL's. An item is called a typed item if it
is a URL. Otherwise, it is a string. Strings cannot contain a period or
a colon (see below).

1.  If the item is a typed item it must be either:
    1.  A defined property name, or
    2.  A valid URL, which refers to the vocabulary definition, or
    3.  A valid URL that is used as a proprietary item property name
        (i.e. one not defined in a public specification), or
2.  If the item is not a typed item it must be:
    1.  A string that contains no "." (U+002E FULL STOP) characters and
        no ":" characters (U+003A COLON) and is used as a proprietary
        item property name (again, one not defined in a public
        specification).

Note: The rules above disallow ":" characters in non-URL values because
otherwise they could not be distinguished from URLs. Values with "."
characters are reserved for future extensions. Space characters are
disallowed because otherwise the values would be parsed as multiple
tokens.

Values

The property value of a name-value pair is as given for the first
matching case in the following list:

-   If the element has an itemscope attribute
    -   The value is the item created by the element
-   If the element is a meta element
    -   The value is the value of the element's content attribute
-   If the element is an audio, embed, iframe, img, source, track, or
    video element
    -   The value is the resulting URL string that results from parsing
        the value of the element's src attribute relative to the node
        document (part of the Microdata DOM API) of the element at the
        time the attribute is set
-   If the element is an a, area, or link element
    -   The value is the resulting URL string that results from parsing
        the value of the element's href attribute relative to the node
        document of the element at the time the attribute is set
-   If the element is an object element
    -   The value is the resulting URL string that results from parsing
        the value of the element's data attribute relative to the node
        document of the element at the time the attribute is set
-   If the element is a data element
    -   The value is the value of the element's value attribute
-   If the element is a meter element
    -   The value is the value of the element's value attribute
-   If the element is a time element
    -   The value is the element's datetime value

Otherwise

-   The value is the element's textContent.

If a property's value is a URL, the property must be specified using a
URL property element. The URL property elements are the a, area, audio,
embed, iframe, img, link, object, source, track, and video elements.

Name order

Names are unordered relative to each other, but if a particular name has
multiple values, they do have a relative order.

In the following example, the "a" property has the values "1" and "2",
in that order, but whether the "a" property comes before the "b"
property or not is not important.

html

    <div itemscope>
      <p itemprop="a">1</p>
      <p itemprop="a">2</p>
      <p itemprop="b">test</p>
    </div>

Here are several equivalent examples:

html

    <div itemscope>
      <p itemprop="b">test</p>
      <p itemprop="a">1</p>
      <p itemprop="a">2</p>
    </div>

html

    <div itemscope>
      <p itemprop="a">1</p>
      <p itemprop="b">test</p>
      <p itemprop="a">2</p>
    </div>

html

    <div id="x">
      <p itemprop="a">1</p>
    </div>
    <div itemscope itemref="x">
      <p itemprop="b">test</p>
      <p itemprop="a">2</p>
    </div>

Representing structured data for a book

This example uses microdata attributes to represent the following
structured data:

  ----------- ------------------ ------------------------------------------------- -------------------------
  itemscope   itemtype: itemid   https://schema.org/Book: urn:isbn:0-374-22848-5

# itemref#

Properties that are not descendants of an element with the itemscope
attribute can be associated with an item using the global attribute
itemref.

itemref provides a list of element IDs (not itemids) elsewhere in the
document, with additional properties

The itemref attribute can only be specified on elements that have an
itemscope attribute specified.

Note: The itemref attribute is not part of the microdata data model. It
is merely a syntactic construct to aid authors in adding annotations to
pages where the data to be annotated does not follow a convenient tree
structure. For example, it allows authors to mark up data in a table so
that each column defines a separate item while keeping the properties in
the cells.

Examples

Representing structured data for a band

This example uses microdata attributes to represent the following
structured data (in JSON-LD format):

json

    {
      "@id": "amanda",
      "name": "Amanda",
      "band": {
        "@id": "b",
        "name": "Jazz Band",
        "size": 12
      }
    }

# itemscope#

itemscope is a boolean global attribute that defines the scope of
associated metadata. Specifying the itemscope attribute for an element
creates a new item, which results in a number of name-value pairs that
are associated with the element.

A related attribute, itemtype, is used to specify the valid URL of a
vocabulary (such as schema.org) that describes the item and its
properties context. In each of the following examples, the vocabulary is
from schema.org.

Every HTML element may have an itemscope attribute specified. An
itemscope element that does not have an associated itemtype must have an
associated itemref.

Note: Find more about itemtype attributes at https://schema.org/Thing

itemscope id attributes

When you specify the itemscope attribute for an element, a new item is
created. The item consists of a group of name-value pairs. For elements
with an itemscope attribute and an itemtype attribute, you may also
specify an id attribute. You can use the id attribute to set a global
identifier for the new item. A global identifier allows the item to
relate to other items found on pages across the Web.

Examples

Representing structured data for a movie

The following example specifies the itemtype as
"http://schema.org/Movie", and specifies four related itemprop
attributes.

  ----------- ---------- ----------------- ------------------------------
  itemscope   Itemtype   Movie             
              itemprop   (itemprop name)   (itemprop value)

Representing structured data for a recipe

There are four itemscope attributes in the following example. Each
itemscope attribute sets the scope of its corresponding itemtype
attribute. The itemtypes, Recipe, AggregateRating, and
NutritionInformation in the following example are part of the schema.org
structured data for a recipe, as specified by the first itemtype,
http://schema.org/Recipe.

# itemtype#

The global attribute itemtype specifies the URL of the vocabulary that
will be used to define itemprop's (item properties) in the data
structure.

itemscope is used to set the scope of where in the data structure the
vocabulary set by itemtype will be active.

Google and other major search engines support the schema.org vocabulary
for structured data. This vocabulary defines a standard set of type
names and property names. For example, MusicEvent indicates a concert
performance, with startDate and location properties specifying the
concert's key details. In this case, MusicEvent would be the URL used by
itemtype, with startDate and location as itemprop's which MusicEvent
defines.

Note: More about itemtype attributes can be found at
https://schema.org/Thing

-   The itemtype attribute must have a value that is an unordered set of
    unique tokens which are case-sensitive, each is a valid and absolute
    URL, and all defined to use the same vocabulary. The attribute's
    value must have at least one token.
-   The item types must all be types defined in applicable
    specifications (such as schema.org), and must all be defined to use
    the same vocabulary.
-   The itemtype attribute can only be specified on elements which have
    an itemscope attribute specified.
-   The itemid attribute can only be specified on elements which have
    both an itemscope attribute and an itemtype attribute specified.
    They must only be specified on elements with an itemscope attribute,
    whose itemtype attribute specifies a vocabulary not supporting
    global identifiers for items, as defined by that vocabulary's
    specification.
-   The exact meaning of a global identifier is determined by the
    vocabulary's specification. It is left to such specifications to
    define whether multiple items of the same global identifier (whether
    on the same page or different pages) are allowed to exist, and what
    processing rules for that vocabulary are, with respect to handling
    the case of multiple items with the same ID.

# lang#

The lang global attribute helps define the language of an element: the
language that non-editable elements are written in, or the language that
the editable elements should be written in by the user. The attribute
contains a single "language tag" in the format defined in RFC 5646: Tags
for Identifying Languages (also known as BCP 47).

Note: The default value of lang is unknown, therefore it is recommended
to always specify this attribute with the appropriate value.

      content: '(In French) ';
    }

If the attribute value is the empty string (lang=""), the language is
set to unknown; if the language tag is not valid according to BCP47, it
is set to invalid.

Even if the lang attribute is set, it may not be taken into account, as
the xml:lang attribute has priority.

For the CSS pseudo-class :lang, two invalid language names are different
if their names are different. So while :lang(es) matches both
lang="es-ES" and lang="es-419", :lang(xyzzy) would not match
lang="xyzzy-Zorp!".

Language tag syntax

The full BCP47 syntax is in-depth enough to mark extremely specific
language dialects, but most usage is much simpler.

A language tag is made of hyphen-separated language subtags, where each
subtag indicates a certain property of the language. The 3 most common
subtags are:

Language subtag

    Required. A 2-or-3-character code that defines the basic language,
    typically written in all lowercase. For example, the language code
    for English is en, and the code for Badeshi is bdz.

Script subtag

    Optional. This subtag defines the writing system used for the
    language, and is always 4 characters long, with the first letter
    capitalized. For example, French-in-Braille is fr-Brai and ja-Kana
    is Japanese written with the Katakana alphabet. If the language is
    written in a highly typical way, like English in the Latin alphabet,
    there is no need to use this subtag.

Region subtag

    Optional. This subtag defines a dialect of the base language from a
    particular location, and is either 2 letters in ALLCAPS matching a
    country code, or 3 numbers matching a non-country area. For example,
    es-ES is for Spanish as spoken in Spain, and es-013 is Spanish as
    spoken in Central America. "International Spanish" would just be es.

The script subtag precedes the region subtag if both are present —
ru-Cyrl-BY is Russian, written in the Cyrillic alphabet, as spoken in
Belarus.

To find the correct subtag codes for a language, try the Language Subtag
Lookup.

Accessibility concerns

WCAG Success Criterion 3.1.1 requires that a page language is specified
in a way which may be 'programmatically determined' (i.e. via the lang
attribute).

WCAG Success Criterion 3.1.2 requires that pages with parts in different
languages have the languages of those parts specified too. Again, the
lang attribute is the correct mechanism for this.

The purpose of these requirements is primarily to allow assistive
technologies such as screen readers to invoke the correct pronunciation.

For example, the language menu on this site (MDN) includes a lang
attribute for each entry:

html

    <div class="dropdown-container language-menu">
      <button
        id="header-language-menu"
        type="button"
        class="dropdown-menu-label"

        aria-owns="language-menu"
        aria-label="Current language is English. Choose your preferred language.">
        English
        <span class="dropdown-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true">▼</span>
      </button>

# nonce#

The nonce global attribute is a content attribute defining a
cryptographic nonce ("number used once") which can be used by Content
Security Policy to determine whether or not a given fetch will be
allowed to proceed for a given element.

Description

The nonce attribute is useful to allowlist specific elements, such as a
particular inline script or style elements. It can help you to avoid
using the CSP unsafe-inline directive, which would allowlist all inline
scripts or styles.

Note: Only use nonce for cases where you have no way around using unsafe
inline script or style contents. If you don't need nonce, don't use it.
If your script is static, you could also use a CSP hash instead. (See
usage notes on unsafe inline script.) Always try to take full advantage
of CSP protections and avoid nonces or unsafe inline scripts whenever
possible.

Using nonce to allowlist a <script> element

There are a few steps involved to allowlist an inline script using the
nonce mechanism:

Generating values

From your web server, generate a random base64-encoded string of at
least 128 bits of data from a cryptographically secure random number
generator. Nonces should be generated differently each time the page
loads (nonce only once!). For example, in nodejs:

js

    const crypto = require("crypto");
    crypto.randomBytes(16).toString("base64");
    // '8IBTHwOdqNKAWeKl7plt8g=='

Allowlisting inline script

The nonce generated on your backend code should now be used for the
inline script that you'd like to allowlist:

html

    <script nonce="8IBTHwOdqNKAWeKl7plt8g==">
      // …
    </script>

Sending a nonce with a CSP header

Finally, you'll need to send the nonce value in a
Content-Security-Policy header (prepend nonce-):

http

    Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-8IBTHwOdqNKAWeKl7plt8g=='

Accessing nonces and nonce hiding

For security reasons, the nonce content attribute is hidden (an empty
string will be returned).

js

    script.getAttribute("nonce"); // returns empty string

The nonce property is the only way to access nonces:

js

    script.nonce; // returns nonce value

Nonce hiding helps prevent attackers from exfiltrating nonce data via
mechanisms that can grab data from content attributes like this:

css

    script[nonce~="whatever"] {
      background: url("https://evil.com/nonce?whatever");
    }

# popover#

Limited availability

This feature is not Baseline because it does not work in some of the
most widely-used browsers.

-   Learn more
-   See full compatibility
-   Report feedback

The popover global attribute is used to designate an element as a
popover element.

Popover elements are hidden via display: none until opened via an
invoking/control element (i.e. a <button> or <input type="button"> with
a popovertarget attribute) or a HTMLElement.showPopover() call.

When open, popover elements will appear above all other elements in the
top layer, and won't be influenced by parent elements' position or
overflow styling.

A popover attribute can have values "auto" (default) or "manual".
Popovers that have the auto state can be "light dismissed" by selecting
outside the popover area, and generally only allow one popover to be
displayed on-screen at a time. By contrast, manual popovers must always
be explicitly hidden, but allow for use cases such as nested popovers in
menus.

For detailed information on usage, see the Popover API landing page.

Examples

The following renders a button that will open a popover element when
activated.

html

    <button popovertarget="my-popover">Open Popover</button>

    <div popover id="my-popover">Greetings, one and all!</div>

# spellcheck#

The spellcheck global attribute is an enumerated attribute that defines
whether the element may be checked for spelling errors.

Note: This attribute is merely a hint for the browser: browsers are not
required to check for spelling errors. Typically non-editable elements
are not checked for spelling errors, even if the spellcheck attribute is
set to true and the browser supports spellchecking.

Output

Console Output

[] clear console

%html-content%

It may have the following values:

-   empty string or true, which indicates that the element should be, if
    possible, checked for spelling errors;
-   false, which indicates that the element should not be checked for
    spelling errors.

If this attribute is not set, its default value is element-type and
browser-defined. This default value may also be inherited, which means
that the element content will be checked for spelling errors only if its
nearest ancestor has a spellcheck state of true.

Security and privacy concerns

Using spellchecking can have consequences for users' security and
privacy. The specification does not regulate how spellchecking is done
and the content of the element may be sent to a third party for
spellchecking results (see enhanced spellchecking and "spell-jacking").

You should consider setting spellcheck to false for elements that can
contain sensitive information.

It accepts an integer as a value, with different results depending on
the integer's value:

Note: If an HTML element renders and has tabindex attribute with any
valid integer value, the element can be focused with JavaScript (by
calling the focus() method) or visually by clicking with the mouse. The
particular tabindex value controls whether the element is tabbable (i.e.
reachable via sequential keyboard navigation, usually with the Tab key).

-   A negative value (the exact negative value doesn't actually matter,
    usually tabindex="-1") means that the element is not reachable via
    sequential keyboard navigation.
    Note: tabindex="-1" may be useful for elements that should not be
    navigated to directly using the Tab key, but need to have keyboard
    focus set to them. Examples include an off-screen modal window that
    should be focused when it comes into view, or a form submission
    error message that should be immediately focused when an errant form
    is submitted.
-   tabindex="0" means that the element should be focusable in
    sequential keyboard navigation, after any positive tabindex values.
    The focus navigation order of these elements is defined by their
    order in the document source.
-   A positive value means the element should be focusable in sequential
    keyboard navigation, with its order defined by the value of the
    number. That is, tabindex="4" is focused before tabindex="5" and
    tabindex="0", but after tabindex="3". If multiple elements share the
    same positive tabindex value, their order relative to each other
    follows their position in the document source. The maximum value for
    tabindex is 32767.
-   If the tabindex attribute is included with no value set, whether the
    element is focusable is determined by the user agent.
    Warning: You are recommended to only use 0 and -1 as tabindex
    values. Avoid using tabindex values greater than 0 and CSS
    properties that can change the order of focusable HTML elements
    (Ordering flex items). Doing so makes it difficult for people who
    rely on using keyboard for navigation or assistive technology to
    navigate and operate page content. Instead, write the document with
    the elements in a logical sequence.

Some focusable HTML elements have a default tabindex value of 0 set
under the hood by the user agent. These elements are an <a> or <area>
with href attribute, <button>, <frame> Deprecated , <iframe>, <input>,
<object>, <select>, <textarea>, and SVG <a> element, or a <summary>
element that provides summary for a <details> element. Developers
shouldn't add the tabindex attribute to these elements unless it changes
the default behavior (for example, including a negative value will
remove the element from the focus navigation order).

Warning: The tabindex attribute must not be used on the <dialog>
element.

Accessibility concerns

Avoid using the tabindex attribute in conjunction with non-interactive
content to make something intended to be interactive focusable by
keyboard input. An example of this would be using a <div> element to
describe a button, instead of the <button> element.

Interactive components authored using non-interactive elements are not
listed in the accessibility tree. This prevents assistive technology
from being able to navigate to and manipulate those components. The
content should be semantically described using interactive elements
(<a>, <button>, <details>, <input>, <select>, <textarea>, etc.) instead.
These elements have built-in roles and states that communicate status to
the accessibility that would otherwise have to be managed by ARIA.

The main use of the title attribute is to label <iframe> elements for
assistive technology.

The title attribute may also be used to label controls in data tables.

The title attribute, when added to <link rel="stylesheet">, creates an
alternate stylesheet. When defining an alternative style sheet with
<link rel="alternate"> the attribute is required and must be set to a
non-empty string.

If included on the <abbr> opening tag, the title must be a full
expansion of the abbreviation or acronym. Instead of using title, when
possible, provide an expansion of the abbreviation or acronym in plain
text on first use, using the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation. This
enables all users know what name or term the abbreviation or acronym
shortens while providing a hint to user agents on how to announce the
content.

While title can be used to provide a programmatically associated label
for an <input> element, this is not good practice. Use a <label>
instead.

Multiline titles

The title attribute may contain several lines. Each U+000A LINE FEED
(LF) character represents a line break. Some caution must be taken, as
this means the following renders across two lines:

HTML

html

    <p>
      Newlines in <code>title</code> should be taken into account. This
      <span
        title="This is a
    multiline title">
        example span
      </span>
      has a title a attribute with a newline.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <pre id="output"></pre>

JavaScript

We can query the title attribute and display it in the empty <pre>
element as follows:

js

    const span = document.querySelector("span");
    const output = document.querySelector("#output");
    output.textContent = span.title;

Result

Title attribute inheritance

If an element has no title attribute, then it inherits it from its
parent node, which in turn may inherit it from its parent, and so on.

If this attribute is set to the empty string, it means its ancestors'
titles are irrelevant and shouldn't be used in the tooltip for this
element.

HTML

html

    <div title="CoolTip">
      <p>Hovering here will show "CoolTip".</p>
      <p title="">Hovering here will show nothing.</p>
    </div>

Result

Accessibility concerns

Use of the title attribute is highly problematic for:

-   People using touch-only devices
-   People navigating with keyboards
-   People navigating with assistive technology such as screen readers
    or magnifiers
-   People experiencing fine motor control impairment
-   People with cognitive concerns

This is due to inconsistent browser support, compounded by the
additional assistive technology parsing of the browser-rendered page. If
a tooltip effect is desired, it is better to use a more accessible
technique that can be accessed with the above browsing methods.

# translate#

The translate global attribute is an enumerated attribute that is used
to specify whether an element's translatable attribute values and its
Text node children should be translated when the page is localized, or
whether to leave them unchanged.

It can have the following values:

-   empty string or yes, which indicates that the element should be
    translated when the page is localized.
-   no, which indicates that the element must not be translated.

Although not all browsers recognize this attribute, it is respected by
automatic translation systems such as Google Translate, and may also be
respected by tools used by human translators. As such it's important
that web authors use this attribute to mark content that should not be
translated.

Examples

In this example, the translate attribute is used to ask translation
tools not to translate the company's brand name in the footer.

html

    <footer>
      <small>© 2020 <span translate="no">BrandName</span></small>
    </footer>

# virtualkeyboardpolicy#

Experimental: This is an experimental technology
Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this in
production.

The virtualkeyboardpolicy global attribute is an enumerated attribute.
When specified on an element that the element's content is editable (for
example, it is an <input> or <textarea> element, or an element with the
contenteditable attribute set), it controls the on-screen virtual
keyboard behavior on devices such as tablets, mobile phones, or other
devices where a hardware keyboard may not be available.

The attribute must take one of the following values:

-   auto or an empty string, which automatically shows the virtual
    keyboard when the element is focused or tapped.
-   manual, which decouples focus and tap on the element from the
    virtual keyboard's state.

# Inline-level content#

In CSS, content that participates in inline layout is called
inline-level content. Most text sequences, replaced elements, and
generated content are inline-level by default.

In inline layout, a mixed stream of text, replaced elements, and other
inline boxes are laid out by fragmenting them into a stack of line
boxes. Within each line box, inline-level boxes are aligned to each
other vertically or horizontally, depending on the writing mode.
Typically, they are aligned by the baselines of their text. This can be
changed with CSS.

[inline layout]

Note: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) elements historically were
categorized as either "block-level" elements or "inline" elements. As a
presentational characteristic, this is now specified by CSS.

Examples

html

    <p>
      This span is an <span class="highlight">inline-level element</span>; its
      background has been colored to display both the beginning and end of the
      element's influence. Input elements, like <input type="radio" /> and
      <input type="checkbox" />, are also inline-level content.
    </p>

In this example, the <p> element contains some text. Within that text is
a <span> element and two <input> elements, which are inline-level
elements. If the <span> is spread across two lines, two line boxes are
generated. Because these elements are inline, the paragraph correctly
renders as a single paragraph of unbroken text flow:

    body {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 4px;
      border: 1px solid #333;
    }

    .highlight {
      background-color: #ee3;
    }

# Microdata#

Microdata is part of the WHATWG HTML Standard and is used to nest
metadata within existing content on web pages. Search engines and web
crawlers can extract and process microdata from a web page and use it to
provide a richer browsing experience for users. Search engines benefit
greatly from direct access to this structured data because it allows
search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide
more relevant results to users. Microdata uses a supporting vocabulary
to describe an item and name-value pairs to assign values to its
properties. Microdata is an attempt to provide a simpler way of
annotating HTML elements with machine-readable tags than the similar
approaches of using RDFa and classic microformats.

At a high level, microdata consists of a group of name-value pairs. The
groups are called items, and each name-value pair is a property. Items
and properties are represented by regular elements.

-   To create an item, the itemscope attribute is used.
-   To add a property to an item, the itemprop attribute is used on one
    of the item's descendants.

Vocabularies

Google and other major search engines support the Schema.org vocabulary
for structured data. This vocabulary defines a standard set of type
names and property names, for example, Schema.org Music Event indicates
a concert performance, with startDate and location properties to specify
the concert's key details. In this case, Schema.org Music Event would be
the URL used by itemtype and startDate and location would be itemprop's
that Schema.org Music Event defines.

Note: More about itemtype attributes can be found at
https://schema.org/Thing.

Microdata vocabularies provide the semantics or meaning of an Item. Web
developers can design a custom vocabulary or use vocabularies available
on the web, such as the widely used schema.org vocabulary. A collection
of commonly used markup vocabularies are provided by Schema.org.

Commonly used vocabularies:

-   Creative works: CreativeWork, Book, Movie, MusicRecording, Recipe,
    TVSeries
-   Embedded non-text objects: AudioObject, ImageObject, VideoObject
-   Event
-   Health and medical types: Notes on the health and medical types
    under MedicalEntity
-   Organization
-   Person
-   Place, LocalBusiness, Restaurant
-   Product, Offer, AggregateOffer
-   Review, AggregateRating
-   Action
-   Thing
-   Intangible

Major search engine operators like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! rely on
the schema.org vocabulary to improve search results. For some purposes,
an ad hoc vocabulary is adequate. For others, a vocabulary will need to
be designed. Where possible, authors are encouraged to re-use existing
vocabularies, as this makes content re-use easier.

Localization

In some cases, search engines covering specific regions may provide
locally-specific extensions of microdata. For example, Yandex, a major
search engine in Russia, supports microformats such as hCard (company
contact information), hRecipe (food recipe), hReview (market reviews)
and hProduct (product data) and provides its own format for the
definition of the terms and encyclopedic articles. This extension was
made to solve transliteration problems between the Cyrillic and Latin
alphabets. Due to the implementation of additional marking parameters of
Schema's vocabulary, the indexation of information in Russian-language
web-pages became considerably more successful.

Global attributes

itemid – The unique, global identifier of an item.

itemprop – Used to add properties to an item. Every HTML element may
have an itemprop attribute specified, where an itemprop consists of a
name and value pair.

itemref – Properties that are not descendants of an element with the
itemscope attribute can be associated with the item using an itemref.
itemref provides a list of element ids (not itemids) with additional
properties elsewhere in the document.

itemscope – The itemscope attribute (usually) works along with itemtype
to specify that the HTML contained in a block is about a particular
item. The itemscope attribute creates the Item and defines the scope of
the itemtype associated with it. The itemtype attribute is a valid URL
of a vocabulary (such as schema.org) that describes the item and its
properties context.

itemtype – Specifies the URL of the vocabulary that will be used to
define itemprop's (item properties) in the data structure. The itemscope
attribute is used to set the scope of where in the data structure the
vocabulary set by itemtype will be active.

Example

HTML

html

    <div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication">
      <span itemprop="name">Angry Birds</span> - REQUIRES
      <span itemprop="operatingSystem">ANDROID</span><br />
      <link
        itemprop="applicationCategory"
        href="https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication" />

      <div
        itemprop="aggregateRating"
        itemscope
        itemtype="https://schema.org/AggregateRating">
        RATING:
        <span itemprop="ratingValue">4.6</span> (
        <span itemprop="ratingCount">8864</span> ratings )
      </div>

      <div itemprop="offers" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Offer">

# Microformats#

Microformats are standards used to embed semantics and structured data
in HTML, and provide an API to be used by social web applications,
search engines, aggregators, and other tools. These minimal patterns of
HTML are used for marking up entities that range from fundamental to
domain-specific information, such as people, organizations, events, and
locations.

-   To create a microformats object, h-* class names are used in the
    class attribute.
-   To add a property to an object, the p-*, u-*, dt-*, e-* class names
    are used on one of the object's descendants.

Microformats use supporting vocabularies to describe objects and
name-value pairs to assign values to their properties. The properties
are carried in class attributes that can be added to any HTML element,
while the data values re-use HTML element content and semantic
attributes.

Microformats2 (sometimes referred to as mf2) is an update to
microformats that provides a simpler way of annotating HTML structured
syntax and vocabularies than previous approaches of using RDFa and
microdata. These previous approaches require learning new attributes.

There are open source parsing libraries for most languages for
microformats2.

How Microformats Work

An author of a webpage can add microformats to their HTML. For example
if they wanted to identify themselves they could use an h-card such as:

HTML Example

html

    <a class="h-card" href="https://alice.example.com">Alice Blogger</a>

When a parser encounters this data, it will know that this page contains
a "card" which describes a person or organization named Alice Blogger
with a URL of https://alice.example.com/. The parser makes this data
available via APIs that can be used for different applications. For
example, an application could scan a page for a h-card to use as profile
information for someone who has signed up to a service.

As in this example, some markup patterns require only a single
microformat root class name, which parsers use to find a few generic
properties such as name, url, photo.

Microformats Use Cases

Microformats have numerous use cases. First, the Webmention standard
uses microformats to provide a way in which messages and comments can be
sent from one site to another. The Webmention specification defines
specific attributes that sites may publish and consume to create a rich,
interoperable way of publishing messages and comments. Microformats can
also be used with Webmentions to enable sending social reactions such as
likes, reposts, and bookmarks from one site to another.

Microformats also enable easy syndication across sites. An aggregator
could parse a page with published microformats to look for information
such as a post title, a post body, and the author of a post. This
aggregator could then use the semantic information gathered to render a
result on their site. For instance, news aggregators and community
posting boards could facilitate submissions and use microformats to
exact relevant content from a page. Further, a website could use
microformats to send crafted requests to third-parties to publish
content, such as social networks.

All major search engines support reading and interpreting microformats.
Search engines benefit greatly from direct access to this structured
data because it allows them to understand the information on web pages.
With this information, search engines can provide more relevant results
to users. Some search engines may render special snippets such as star
ratings on a search result page based on the data provided in
microformats.

In addition to being machine-readable, microformats are designed to be
easily read by humans. This approach makes it easy for people to
understand and maintain microformats data.

Microformats Prefixes

All microformats consist of a root, and a collection of properties.
Properties are all optional and potentially multivalued - applications
needing a singular value may use the first instance of a property.
Hierarchical data is represented with nested microformats, typically as
property values themselves.

All microformats class names use prefixes. Prefixes are syntax
independent of vocabularies, which are developed separately.

-   "h-*" for root class names, e.g. "h-card", "h-entry", "h-feed", and
    many more. These top-level root classes usually indicate a type and
    corresponding expected vocabulary of properties. For example:
    -   h-card describes a person or organization
    -   h-entry describes episodic or date stamped online content like a
        blog post
    -   h-feed describes a stream or feed of posts
    -   You can find many more vocabularies on the microformats2 wiki.
-   "p-*" for plain (text) properties, e.g. "p-name", "p-summary"
    -   Generic plain text parsing, element text in general. On certain
        HTML elements, use special attributes first, e.g. img/alt,
        abbr/title.
-   "u-*" for URL properties, e.g. "u-url", "u-photo", "u-logo"
    -   Special parsing: element attributes a/href, img/src, object/data
        etc. attributes over element contents.
-   "dt-*" for datetime properties, e.g. "dt-start", "dt-end", "dt-bday"
    -   Special parsing: time element datetime attribute,
        value-class-pattern and separate date time value parsing for
        readability.
-   "e-*" for element tree properties where the entire contained element
    hierarchy is the value, e.g. "e-content". The "e-" prefix can also
    be mnemonically remembered as "element tree", "embedded markup", or
    "encapsulated markup".

Some microformats examples

h-card

The h-card microformat represents a person or organization.

The value of each property is defined in HTML using the class property
any element can carry

Example h-card

html

    <p class="h-card">
      <img class="u-photo" src="https://example.org/photo.png" alt="" />
      <a class="p-name u-url" href="https://example.org">Joe Bloggs</a>
      <a class="u-email" href="mailto:jbloggs@example.com">jbloggs@example.com</a>,
      <span class="p-street-address">17 Austerstræti</span>
      <span class="p-locality">Reykjavík</span>
      <span class="p-country-name">Iceland</span>
    </p>

  Property           Description
  ------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------
  p-name             The full/formatted name of the person or organization.
  u-email            email address
  u-photo            a photo of the person or organization
  u-url              home page or other URL representing the person or organization
  u-uid              universally unique identifier, preferably canonical URL
  p-street-address   street number + name
  p-locality         city/town/village
  p-country-name     country name

Nested h-card example

html

    <div class="h-card">
      <a class="p-name u-url" href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/">
        Mitchell Baker
      </a>
      (<a class="p-org h-card" href="https://mozilla.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a>)
    </div>

Parsed JSON:

json

    {
      "items": [
        {
          "type": ["h-card"],
          "properties": {
            "name": ["Mitchell Baker"],
            "url": ["https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/"],
            "org": [
              {
                "value": "Mozilla Foundation",
                "type": ["h-card"],
                "properties": {
                  "name": ["Mozilla Foundation"],
                  "url": ["https://mozilla.org/"]
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }

In this example, a h-card is specified for both a person and the
organization they represent. The person's affiliation with the linked
organization is specified using the p-org property.

Note: the nested h-card has implied 'name' and 'url' properties, just
like any other root-class-name-only h-card on an <a href> would.

h-entry

The h-entry microformat represents episodic or datestamped content on
the web. h-entry is often used with content intended to be syndicated,
e.g. blog posts and short notes.

Example h-entry as a blog post:

html

    <article class="h-entry">
      <h1 class="p-name">Microformats are amazing</h1>
      <p>
        Published by
        <a class="p-author h-card" href="https://example.com">W. Developer</a> on
        <time class="dt-published" datetime="2013-06-13 12:00:00">
          13<sup>th</sup> June 2013
        </time>
      </p>

      <p class="p-summary">In which I extoll the virtues of using microformats.</p>

      <div class="e-content">
        <p>Blah blah blah</p>
      </div>
    </article>

Properties

  Property       Description
  -------------- -------------------------------------------------
  p-name         entry name/title
  p-author       who wrote the entry, optionally embedded h-card
  dt-published   when the entry was published
  p-summary      short entry summary
  e-content      full content of the entry

Parsed reply h-entry example

html

    <div class="h-entry">

Microformats rel property examples

There are some microformats that are applied to a page by using a
special rel= property. These microformats describe a relation between a
current document and a linked document. For a full list of these, see
the rel property on the microformats wiki.

rel=author

This attribute states that the linked document represents the author of
the current page.

html

    <a rel="author" href="https://jamesg.blog">James Gallagher</a>

rel=license

This attribute states that the linked document contains the license
under which the current page is published.

html

    <a rel="license" href="https://mit-license.org/">MIT License</a>

rel=nofollow

This attribute states that the linked document should not be given any
weight by search engine ranking algorithms that may derive from the
current page. This is useful to prevent link graph algorithms from
weighing a page higher than it otherwise would after seeing a link to a
document.

html

    <a rel="nofollow" href="https://jamesg.blog">James Gallagher</a>

Browser compatibility

Supported in all browsers' support for the class attribute and its DOM
API.

# Quirks Mode#

In the old days of the web, pages were typically written in two
versions: One for Netscape Navigator, and one for Microsoft Internet
Explorer. When the web standards were made at W3C, browsers could not
just start using them, as doing so would break most existing sites on
the web. Browsers therefore introduced two modes to treat new standards
compliant sites differently from old legacy sites.

There are now three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers:
quirks mode, limited-quirks mode, and no-quirks mode. In quirks mode,
layout emulates behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5. This is
essential in order to support websites that were built before the
widespread adoption of web standards. In no-quirks mode, the behavior is
(hopefully) the desired behavior described by the modern HTML and CSS
specifications. In limited-quirks mode, there are only a very small
number of quirks implemented.

The limited-quirks and no-quirks modes used to be called
"almost-standards" mode and "full standards" mode, respectively. These
names have been changed as the behavior is now standardized.

How do browsers determine which mode to use?

For HTML documents, browsers use a DOCTYPE in the beginning of the
document to decide whether to handle it in quirks mode or standards
mode. To ensure that your page uses full standards mode, make sure that
your page has a DOCTYPE like in this example:

html

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Hello World!</title>
      </head>
      <body></body>
    </html>

The DOCTYPE shown in the example, <!DOCTYPE html>, is the simplest
possible, and the one recommended by current HTML standards. Earlier
versions of the HTML standard recommended other variants, but all
existing browsers today will use full standards mode for this DOCTYPE,
even the dated Internet Explorer 6. There are no valid reasons to use a
more complicated DOCTYPE. If you do use another DOCTYPE, you may risk
choosing one which triggers almost standards mode or quirks mode.

Make sure you put the DOCTYPE right at the beginning of your HTML
document. Anything before the DOCTYPE, like a comment or an XML
declaration will trigger quirks mode in Internet Explorer 9 and older.

The only purpose of <!DOCTYPE html> is to activate no-quirks mode. Older
versions of HTML standard DOCTYPEs provided additional meaning, but no
browser ever used the DOCTYPE for anything other than switching between
render modes.

See also a detailed description of when different browsers choose
various modes.

XHTML

If you serve your page as XHTML using the application/xhtml+xml MIME
type in the Content-Type HTTP header, you do not need a DOCTYPE to
enable standards mode, as such documents always use 'full standards
mode'. Note however that serving your pages as application/xhtml+xml
will cause Internet Explorer 8 to show a download dialog box for an
unknown format instead of displaying your page, as the first version of
Internet Explorer with support for XHTML is Internet Explorer 9.

If you serve XHTML-like content using the text/html MIME type, browsers
will read it as HTML, and you will need the DOCTYPE to use standards
mode.

How do I see which mode is used?

If the page is rendered in quirks or limited-quirks mode, Firefox will
log a warning to the console tab in the developer tools. If this warning
is not shown, Firefox is using no-quirks mode.

The value of document.compatMode in JavaScript will show whether or not
the document is in quirks mode. If its value is "BackCompat", the
document is in quirks mode. If it isn't, it will have value
"CSS1Compat".

This HTML reference describes all elements and attributes of HTML,
including global attributes that apply to all elements.

HTML element reference

    This page lists all the HTML elements, which are created using tags.

HTML attribute reference

    Elements in HTML have attributes; these are additional values that
    configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways to
    meet the criteria the users want.

Global attributes

    Global attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements; they
    can be used on all elements, though they may have no effect on some
    elements.

Content categories

    Every HTML element is a member of one or more content categories —
    these categories group elements that share common characteristics.

Date and time formats used in HTML

    Certain HTML elements allow you to specify dates and/or times as the
    value or as the value of an attribute. These include the date and
    time variations of the <input> element as well as the <ins> and
    <del> elements.

# Viewport meta tag#

This article describes how to use the "viewport" <meta> tag to control
the viewport's size and shape.

Background

The browser's viewport is the area of the window in which web content
can be seen. This is often not the same size as the rendered page, in
which case the browser provides scrollbars for the user to scroll around
and access all the content.

Some mobile devices and other narrow screens render pages in a virtual
window or viewport, which is usually wider than the screen, and then
shrink the rendered result down so it can all be seen at once. Users can
then zoom and pan to look more closely at different areas of the page.
For example, if a mobile screen has a width of 640px, pages might be
rendered with a virtual viewport of 980px, and then it will be shrunk
down to fit into the 640px space.

This is done because not all pages are optimized for mobile and break
(or at least look bad) when rendered at a small viewport width. This
virtual viewport is a way to make non-mobile-optimized sites in general
look better on narrow screen devices.

However, this mechanism is not so good for pages that are optimized for
narrow screens using media queries — if the virtual viewport is 980px
for example, media queries that kick in at 640px or 480px or less will
never be used, limiting the effectiveness of such responsive design
techniques. The viewport <meta> element mitigates this problem of
virtual viewport on narrow screen devices.

Viewport basics

A typical mobile-optimized site contains something like the following:

html

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

Not all devices are the same width; you should make sure that your pages
work well in a large variation of screen sizes and orientations.

The basic attributes of the "viewport" <meta> element include:

width

    Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific
    number of pixels like width=600 or to the special value
    device-width, which is 100vw, or 100% of the viewport width.
    Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.

height

    Controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific
    number of pixels like height=400 or to the special value
    device-height, which is 100vh, or 100% of the viewport height.
    Minimum: 1. Maximum: 10000. Negative values: ignored.

initial-scale

    Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. Minimum: 0.1.
    Maximum: 10. Default: 1. Negative values: ignored.

minimum-scale

    Controls how much zoom out is allowed on the page. Minimum: 0.1.
    Maximum: 10. Default: 0.1. Negative values: ignored.

maximum-scale

    Controls how much zoom in is allowed on the page. Any value less
    than 3 fails accessibility. Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 10.
    Negative values: ignored.

user-scalable

    Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the
    page. Valid values: 0, 1, yes, or no. Default: 1, which is the same
    as yes. Setting the value to 0, which is the same as no, is against
    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

interactive-widget

    Specifies the effect that interactive UI widgets, such as a virtual
    keyboard, have on the page's viewports. Valid values:
    resizes-visual, resizes-content, or overlays-content. Default:
    resizes-visual.

Warning: Usage of user-scalable=no can cause accessibility issues to
users with visual impairments such as low vision. WCAG requires a
minimum of 2× scaling; however, the best practice is to enable a 5×
zoom.

Screen density

Screen resolutions have risen to the size that individual pixels are
indistinguishable by the human eye. For example, smartphones often have
small screens with resolutions upwards of 1920–1080 pixels (≈400dpi).
Because of this, many browsers can display their pages in a smaller
physical size by translating multiple hardware pixels for each CSS
"pixel". Initially, this caused usability and readability problems on
many touch-optimized websites.

On high dpi screens, pages with initial-scale=1 will effectively be
zoomed by browsers. Their text will be smooth and crisp, but their
bitmap images may not take advantage of the full screen resolution. To
get sharper images on these screens, web developers may want to design
images – or whole layouts – at a higher scale than their final size and
then scale them down using CSS or viewport properties.

The default pixel ratio depends on the display density. On a display
with density less than 200dpi, the ratio is 1.0. On displays with
density between 200 and 300dpi, the ratio is 1.5. For displays with
density over 300dpi, the ratio is the integer floor (density/150dpi).
Note that the default ratio is true only when the viewport scale
equals 1. Otherwise, the relationship between CSS pixels and device
pixels depends on the current zoom level.

Viewport width and screen width

Sites can set their viewport to a specific size. For example, the
definition "width=320, initial-scale=1" can be used to fit precisely
onto a small phone display in portrait mode. This can cause problems
when the browser renders a page at a larger size. To fix this, browsers
will expand the viewport width if necessary to fill the screen at the
requested scale. This is especially useful on large-screen devices.

For pages that set an initial or maximum scale, this means the width
property actually translates into a minimum viewport width. For example,
if your layout needs at least 500 pixels of width then you can use the
following markup. When the screen is more than 500 pixels wide, the
browser will expand the viewport (rather than zoom in) to fit the
screen:

html

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=500, initial-scale=1" />

Other attributes that are available are minimum-scale, maximum-scale,
and user-scalable. These properties affect the initial scale and width,
as well as limiting changes in zoom level.

The effect of interactive UI widgets

Interactive UI widgets of the browser can influence the size of the
page's viewports. The most common such UI widget is a virtual keyboard.
To control which resize behavior the browser should use, set the
interactive-widget property.

Allowed values are:

resizes-visual

    The visual viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.

resizes-content

    The viewport gets resized by the interactive widget.

overlays-content

    Neither the viewport nor the visual viewport gets resized by the
    interactive widget.

When the viewport gets resized, the initial containing block also gets
resized, thereby affecting the computed size of viewport units.

Common viewport sizes for mobile and tablet devices

If you want to know what mobile and tablet devices have which viewport
widths, there is a comprehensive list of mobile and tablet viewport
sizes here. This gives information such as viewport width on portrait
and landscape orientation as well as physical screen size, operating
system and the pixel density of the device.
